# Understanding the `useLayoutEffect` Hook in React

## Introduction

In React, we often want to perform side effects — actions like data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulations, etc. We typically use the `useEffect` hook for this. However, there are situations where timing is critical, especially when dealing with **DOM measurements** and **mutations** that must happen **before the browser paints the screen**. This is where the `useLayoutEffect` hook comes into play.

The `useLayoutEffect` hook is almost identical to `useEffect` but differs in **timing**. While `useEffect` runs **after** the paint, `useLayoutEffect` runs **before** the browser has a chance to paint, ensuring that any DOM changes are applied immediately. This prevents visual glitches or "flashes of incorrect layout."

## Explanation

### What is `useLayoutEffect`?

`useLayoutEffect` is a React hook that lets you perform DOM mutations **synchronously** after the component renders but **before** the browser paints the changes on the screen.

**Key Points:**

* Runs **synchronously** after all DOM mutations.
* Blocks the browser from painting until it finishes.
* Useful for measuring layout and applying mutations based on those measurements.

### Syntax

```javascript
import { useLayoutEffect } from 'react';

useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // Your effect logic here
  return () => {
    // Cleanup logic here (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

**Parameters:**

* A **function** that contains your side effect logic.
* An optional **dependency array** to control when the effect re-runs.

### How `useLayoutEffect` Works Internally

When React renders your component:

1. It first paints the virtual DOM.
2. It then updates the real DOM.
3. Before the browser has a chance to paint the updated UI, React runs `useLayoutEffect`.
4. After `useLayoutEffect` completes, the browser proceeds to paint.

In contrast:

* `useEffect` runs after the paint is complete.

This synchronous behavior can cause layout thrashing if not used carefully but ensures that the user never sees an incorrect or interim layout.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Measuring DOM Elements**

Suppose you want to measure an element’s size or position **immediately after it renders** and adjust it. If you use `useEffect`, the user might see the "wrong" position for a brief moment. `useLayoutEffect` solves this.

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const divRef = useRef();

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const rect = divRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
    console.log('Width:', rect.width, 'Height:', rect.height);
    // Maybe set some state based on measurements
  }, []);

  return <div ref={divRef}>Measure me!</div>;
};
```

### 2. **Animating Layout Changes**

In a **photo gallery app**, you might want to animate the transition of photos when the layout changes. To calculate the starting and ending positions correctly, you need synchronous measurements before the paint.

```javascript
const PhotoGallery = ({ photos }) => {
  const galleryRef = useRef();

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const galleryWidth = galleryRef.current.offsetWidth;
    // Logic to calculate and set animation start positions
  }, [photos]);

  return (
    <div ref={galleryRef}>
      {photos.map(photo => (
        <img key={photo.id} src={photo.url} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Resizing a Box Without Flicker

```javascript
import React, { useState, useRef, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';

function ResizableBox() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState(100);
  const boxRef = useRef();

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // Directly set style without flicker
    boxRef.current.style.width = `${size}px`;
    boxRef.current.style.height = `${size}px`;
  }, [size]);

  return (
    <div>
      <div
        ref={boxRef}
        style={{ backgroundColor: 'lightblue' }}
      >
        Resizable Box
      </div>
      <button onClick={() => setSize(size + 20)}>Increase Size</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Example 2: Prevent Scroll Jumps

Suppose you dynamically add content at the top of a list and want to preserve the scroll position.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useLayoutEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Chat() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const containerRef = useRef();

  const addMessage = () => {
    setMessages(prev => [`New Message ${prev.length + 1}`, ...prev]);
  };

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // Scroll adjustment before paint
    containerRef.current.scrollTop = 0;
  }, [messages]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={addMessage}>Add Message</button>
      <div ref={containerRef} style={{ height: 200, overflow: 'auto' }}>
        {messages.map((msg, index) => (
          <div key={index}>{msg}</div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

* ✅ **Use only when necessary:** Prefer `useEffect` unless you notice visual glitches.
* ✅ **Measure and mutate DOM safely:** Don’t cause unnecessary reflows or layout thrashing.
* ❌ **Don’t perform heavy computations:** Since `useLayoutEffect` blocks painting, heavy work can freeze the UI.
* ✅ **Use cleanups wisely:** Always return a cleanup function if the effect sets up subscriptions or timers.

## Key Takeaways

* `useLayoutEffect` is similar to `useEffect`, but runs **before** the paint phase.
* It is useful for **DOM measurements** and **synchronous mutations**.
* **Timing difference**:

  * `useEffect`: After paint (async).
  * `useLayoutEffect`: Before paint (sync).
* Use it carefully — it can block rendering and cause performance issues if overused.
* Prefer `useEffect` unless you **need to prevent visual glitches** or **measure layout**.

## Advanced Insights

### Difference Between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`

| Feature       | `useEffect`                | `useLayoutEffect`              |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Timing        | After paint                | Before paint                   |
| Performance   | Non-blocking               | Blocking                       |
| Use Case      | Data fetching, logging     | DOM measurements, layout fixes |
| Browser paint | Happens before effect runs | Happens after effect runs      |
| Risk          | Minimal                    | Risk of jank if misused        |

### Gotchas

* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** `useLayoutEffect` will throw a warning if used during SSR because there's no DOM. Prefer `useEffect` or guard it:

```javascript
import { useLayoutEffect, useEffect } from 'react';

const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
  typeof window !== 'undefined' ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
```

This pattern is often used in libraries like Next.js to avoid warnings.
