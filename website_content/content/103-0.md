# Prototypes and Inheritance in JavaScript

## Introduction

In JavaScript, everything is an object — or at least, behaves like one. Behind the scenes, JavaScript uses a feature called **prototypes** to implement **inheritance**, allowing objects to share properties and methods.

Understanding **prototypes and inheritance** is crucial because it underpins how objects interact, how code reusability is achieved, and how JavaScript's object system is fundamentally different from class-based languages like Java or C++.

Think of it this way:

> In many languages, classes come first and objects are instances of classes.
> In JavaScript, objects come first and classes (introduced later) are syntactic sugar over prototypes.

If you're building complex applications — think e-commerce platforms or social media apps — knowing how inheritance works in JavaScript will make your code more efficient and maintainable.

## Explanation

### What is a Prototype?

A **prototype** is a hidden object that is associated with every JavaScript function and object. When you try to access a property or method on an object and it doesn't exist, JavaScript automatically looks up the property in the object's prototype.

Each object has a **`[[Prototype]]`** (internal link) to another object, which is its prototype. You can access this chain via the `__proto__` property (deprecated but still visible) or `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`.

This lookup mechanism is known as the **prototype chain**.

### How Inheritance Works with Prototypes

Inheritance allows an object to access properties and methods of another object. In JavaScript, this is done through the prototype chain:

1. When you access a property on an object:

   * JavaScript first checks the object itself.
   * If not found, it looks at the object's prototype.
   * If still not found, it moves up the prototype chain until it either finds the property or reaches `null`.

> This is called **prototypal inheritance**.

### Syntax and Examples

#### 1. Traditional Prototypal Inheritance (Before ES6)

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
};

const dog = new Animal('Dog');
dog.speak(); // Dog makes a noise.
```

Here, `speak` is not defined on `dog` directly. It is found through `dog`'s prototype, which is `Animal.prototype`.

#### 2. Object.create()

A more explicit way to set prototypes:

```javascript
const animal = {
  speak: function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.name = 'Dog';
dog.speak(); // Dog makes a noise.
```

`Object.create()` sets the prototype of `dog` to `animal`.

#### 3. ES6 Classes (Syntactic Sugar)

ES6 introduced `class` syntax, but internally it still uses prototypes.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Animal('Dog');
dog.speak(); // Dog makes a noise.
```

Under the hood, methods like `speak` are attached to `Animal.prototype`.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. E-commerce Product Models

Imagine an e-commerce app where you have different kinds of products: `Book`, `Electronics`, `Clothing`.

Instead of copying the same methods (like `calculateDiscount()`) into each type, you can use prototypes or classes to define common behavior:

```javascript
function Product(name, price) {
  this.name = name;
  this.price = price;
}

Product.prototype.calculateDiscount = function(percent) {
  return this.price - (this.price * percent / 100);
};

const book = new Product('JavaScript Guide', 500);
console.log(book.calculateDiscount(10)); // 450
```

### 2. User Roles in a Social Media App

Different user types (`Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`) can inherit from a base `User` class.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(username) {
    this.username = username;
  }

  logInfo() {
    console.log(`User: ${this.username}`);
  }
}

class Admin extends User {
  deletePost(postId) {
    console.log(`Post ${postId} deleted by ${this.username}`);
  }
}

const admin = new Admin('admin123');
admin.logInfo();         // User: admin123
admin.deletePost(101);    // Post 101 deleted by admin123
```

## Code Examples

### Prototype Chain Visualization

```javascript
function A() {
  this.a = 'A';
}

function B() {
  this.b = 'B';
}

B.prototype = new A();

const obj = new B();
console.log(obj.b); // B
console.log(obj.a); // A (inherited from A)
```

**Prototype chain**:

```
obj --> B.prototype --> A.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null
```

## Best Practices

* **Favor Composition over Inheritance**: Deep prototype chains can become confusing. Sometimes combining smaller objects (composition) is better.
* **Use `class` syntax**: It's more readable and familiar to developers from other languages.
* **Avoid modifying built-in prototypes** (like `Array.prototype` or `Object.prototype`): It can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Check property ownership with `hasOwnProperty`**:

  ```javascript
  obj.hasOwnProperty('prop'); // true if 'prop' is own property
  ```
* **Use `Object.create(null)`** for objects without prototypes when you want a truly clean object.

---

## Common Mistakes

* **Forgetting `new` keyword**:

  ```javascript
  const dog = Animal('Dog'); // Wrong: `this` will be undefined
  const dog = new Animal('Dog'); // Correct
  ```

* **Accidentally overriding prototype properties**:

  ```javascript
  Animal.prototype = {}; // Overwrites existing methods like `constructor`
  ```

* **Mutating shared objects in prototypes**:

  If you define an object or array in a prototype, all instances will share it.

  ```javascript
  function Person() {}
  Person.prototype.hobbies = [];

  const p1 = new Person();
  const p2 = new Person();
  p1.hobbies.push('Reading');
  console.log(p2.hobbies); // ['Reading'] - unintended sharing
  ```

## Key Takeaways

* **Prototype** is a mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
* **Prototypal Inheritance** allows one object to access properties/methods of another via the prototype chain.
* `Object.create()`, constructor functions, and ES6 `class` are different ways to set up inheritance.
* **Classes** are syntactic sugar over prototype-based inheritance.
* Use **composition** when inheritance becomes too deep or complicated.
* Avoid **modifying built-in prototypes**.
* Always **use `new`** with constructor functions.

## Advanced Insights

* **Shadowing Properties**: If you define a property directly on the object that exists in the prototype, the object's property shadows (hides) the prototype property.

  ```javascript
  dog.speak = function() {
    console.log('Woof!');
  };
  dog.speak(); // Woof! (overrides prototype method)
  ```

* **`super` keyword** in classes allows calling methods on an object's parent.

  ```javascript
  class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
      super.speak(); // Calls Animal's speak
      console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
  }
  ```

* **Prototype Pollution**: A type of security vulnerability where an attacker can modify the prototype of a base object, affecting all objects. Always sanitize inputs!
