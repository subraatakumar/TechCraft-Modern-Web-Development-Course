# Hoisting in JavaScript

## Introduction

When you first start writing JavaScript, you might come across some puzzling behavior â€” like using a function or variable *before* it's even defined in the code! How does that work? The answer lies in a fundamental JavaScript concept called **Hoisting**.

**Hoisting** is JavaScriptâ€™s default behavior of moving *declarations* to the top of the current scope (script or function) before the code is executed. It helps JavaScript developers write code more flexibly but can also lead to confusion and subtle bugs if not properly understood.

Understanding hoisting is important because it influences how and when variables and functions are available in your code, even before they are written.

## Explanation

In technical terms, during the compilation phase â€” before the code is actually executed â€” JavaScript scans through the code and allocates memory for variables and function declarations. This process lifts (*hoists*) the **declarations** to the top of their respective scopes.

Important things to note:

* **Only declarations** are hoisted, not initializations (assignments).
* **Function declarations** are fully hoisted, meaning they are available entirely before the code is run.
* **`var` declarations** are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
* **`let` and `const`** are hoisted too but stay in a **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** until they are initialized, meaning you cannot access them before the actual line where they are declared.

### What gets hoisted?

| Type                 | Hoisted?                          | Value before initialization                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `var`                | Yes                               | `undefined`                                |
| `let` / `const`      | Yes                               | Not accessible (TDZ)                       |
| Function Declaration | Yes                               | Actual function                            |
| Function Expression  | No (only variable is hoisted)     | `undefined` if `var`, TDZ if `let`/`const` |
| Arrow Functions      | No (same as function expressions) | Same as above                              |

## How it Works Internally

When a JavaScript engine (like V8) executes your code, it does two main passes:

1. **Creation Phase (Compilation)**:

   * Allocate memory for variables and functions.
   * Set up the scope chain.
   * Variables declared with `var` are set to `undefined`.
   * Variables with `let` and `const` are placed in the TDZ.
   * Function declarations are fully hoisted.

2. **Execution Phase**:

   * Code is run line-by-line.
   * Variables are assigned values when the code execution reaches their assignment statements.

This explains why you can call a function defined later in the code but cannot safely use a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **E-commerce Site: Early Access of Helper Functions**

In a shopping cart script, you might want to call helper functions before you declare them to organize code better.

```javascript
applyDiscount(cart); // âœ… Works due to hoisting

function applyDiscount(cart) {
  // logic to apply discount
}
```

Here, the function `applyDiscount` is hoisted completely, allowing you to call it even before its declaration.

### 2. **Social Media App: Variable Hoisting Pitfall**

Imagine managing a `userStatus` in a social app:

```javascript
console.log(userStatus); // undefined, not ReferenceError

var userStatus = "Active";
```

Because `var` is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`, the log shows `undefined` instead of throwing an error. This might lead to subtle bugs if the developer expected an error when using a variable before its initialization.

---

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Function Declaration Hoisting

```javascript
sayHello(); // Output: Hello!

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

**Why?** The `sayHello` function is hoisted fully.

---

### Example 2: `var` Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(a); // Output: undefined

var a = 10;
```

**Why?** `var a` is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.

---

### Example 3: `let` and `const` Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization

let b = 20;
```

**Why?** `let` and `const` are hoisted but stay in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until initialized.

---

### Example 4: Function Expression Hoisting

```javascript
greet(); // TypeError: greet is not a function

var greet = function() {
  console.log("Hi!");
};
```

**Why?** Only `greet`'s variable declaration is hoisted (`var greet` is `undefined` initially). The assignment happens at runtime.

---

## Best Practices

* **Declare variables at the top** of their scope to make the hoisting effect clear and code more readable.
* **Use `let` and `const`** over `var` to avoid `undefined` surprises and leverage the Temporal Dead Zone for better error checking.
* **Declare functions before they are called** for clarity, even though hoisting will allow otherwise.
* **Prefer function declarations** over function expressions when you need early access to functions.
* **Avoid relying on hoisting** for program logic â€” it can lead to hard-to-find bugs.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Hoisting is JavaScriptâ€™s behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.
* `var` is hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
* `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized (TDZ).
* Function declarations are fully hoisted with their definitions.
* Function expressions and arrow functions are treated like variables (`var`, `let`, or `const`).
* Hoisting can lead to confusing behavior if not properly understood.

---

## Advanced Insights

* **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**: A period between entering scope and variable declaration where accessing the variable will throw a `ReferenceError`. This applies to `let` and `const`.

* **Block vs. Function Scope**:

  * `var` is function-scoped, not block-scoped. So even if you declare it inside an `if` or `for` block, it's hoisted to the top of the function, not just the block.

```javascript
function test() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 5;
  }
  console.log(x); // 5 (NOT a block scope)
}
```

* **Hoisting in Classes**: Classes are also hoisted but like `let`/`const`, they are not initialized. Using a class before it's declared will throw a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
const obj = new MyClass(); // ReferenceError

class MyClass {}
```
