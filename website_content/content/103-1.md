# Basic Functional Programming Concepts (Pure Functions, Immutability)

## Introduction

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutating data.

Two of the core pillars of functional programming are:

* **Pure Functions**
* **Immutability**

Understanding these concepts is essential because they lead to code that is more predictable, easier to test, and less prone to bugs. These principles are particularly important in JavaScript, where managing application state (in frameworks like React) has become crucial.

## Explanation

### 1. Pure Functions

**Definition**: A *pure function* is a function where the output value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects.

#### Key Characteristics:

* **Given the same input, always returns the same output.**
* **No side effects** (no modification of external variables, no DOM manipulation, no API calls inside the function, etc.).

#### Why Pure Functions?

Pure functions are predictable and testable. They make debugging easier because they don’t depend on or modify external state.

### 2. Immutability

**Definition**: *Immutability* means that an object cannot be modified after it is created. Instead of changing an object, you create a new one with the updated values.

#### Key Characteristics:

* **No in-place mutation**: Original data remains unchanged.
* **Returns new copies** when changes are required.

#### Why Immutability?

Immutability helps avoid unexpected bugs that arise from shared mutable state. It makes applications more predictable, especially in concurrent or asynchronous programming.

## How It Works Internally

In JavaScript:

* Functions capture their inputs and return outputs based solely on the inputs without altering anything outside their scope.
* Immutability can be enforced using:

  * **Primitive types** (e.g., numbers, strings) — inherently immutable.
  * **Objects/arrays** — use methods like `Object.freeze()`, or create new objects via spread syntax or utility libraries like Lodash or Immutable.js.

**Note**: JavaScript objects are mutable by default, so immutability must be enforced consciously.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. E-commerce: Shopping Cart Updates

In an e-commerce application, updating a shopping cart using pure functions ensures that the cart is updated without mutating the original cart object.

### 2. Social Media: Feed Updates

When fetching and updating a user’s feed in a social media app, ensuring immutability ensures users' old feed remains unchanged while new posts are added.

## Code Examples

### Pure Functions

```javascript
// Pure function example
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Impure function example (modifies external variable)
let total = 0;
function addToTotal(amount) {
  total += amount; // Side effect: modifies external state
}
```

---

### Immutability

```javascript
// Immutable update of an array
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];

// Using spread operator to create a new array
const newArray = [...originalArray, 4];

console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3] - unchanged
console.log(newArray);      // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Immutable update of an object
const user = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25
};

const updatedUser = {
  ...user,
  age: 26
};

console.log(user);        // { name: 'Alice', age: 25 } - unchanged
console.log(updatedUser); // { name: 'Alice', age: 26 }
```

## Best Practices

* **Keep functions pure**: Avoid external state dependencies inside functions.
* **Avoid side effects**: No modifying global variables, DOM elements, or performing I/O inside your functions.
* **Use modern syntax**: Prefer using the spread operator (`...`) for creating new copies of objects and arrays.
* **Libraries**: Consider using libraries like Immutable.js or Immer for complex immutable data handling.
* **Testing**: Pure functions are easier to write unit tests for — take advantage of that.

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Pure Functions**:

  * Same input → same output.
  * No side effects.

* **Immutability**:

  * Data structures cannot be changed once created.
  * Use techniques like spread syntax to create copies.

* **Benefits**:

  * Easier debugging and testing.
  * Safer, more predictable code.
  * Especially useful in asynchronous and concurrent applications.

## Advanced Insights (Optional)

* **Referential Transparency**: Pure functions exhibit referential transparency — an expression can be replaced with its value without changing the program’s behavior.
* **Structural Sharing**: Libraries like Immutable.js use structural sharing internally to optimize memory use — new versions share unchanged parts of the data structure.
* **Currying and Composition**: FP heavily leans on concepts like currying and function composition, making complex logic more modular and reusable.
