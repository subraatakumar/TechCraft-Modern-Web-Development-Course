# Basic Regular Expressions in JavaScript

## Introduction

In programming, especially when dealing with text, you often need to search, match, or validate patterns. This is where **Regular Expressions** (or **Regex**) come in.

**Regular Expressions** are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, they are extremely useful for tasks like:

* Validating user input (e.g., email, phone numbers)
* Searching and replacing substrings
* Extracting information from a text

Understanding **basic regular expressions** can save you from writing long and complicated code for simple pattern matching tasks.

## Explanation

### What is a Regular Expression?

A **Regular Expression** is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. In JavaScript, you can create a RegExp object in two ways:

* **Literal notation**:

  ```javascript
  const regex = /abc/;
  ```

* **Constructor function**:

  ```javascript
  const regex = new RegExp('abc');
  ```

Both achieve the same result but the literal syntax is shorter and easier for most cases.

### Basic Syntax

Here’s a breakdown of the basic elements of regular expressions:

| Symbol  | Description                                                |                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `.`     | Matches any single character except newline                |                          |
| `^`     | Matches the beginning of a string                          |                          |
| `$`     | Matches the end of a string                                |                          |
| `*`     | Matches 0 or more occurrences                              |                          |
| `+`     | Matches 1 or more occurrences                              |                          |
| `?`     | Matches 0 or 1 occurrence                                  |                          |
| `[]`    | Matches any one of the enclosed characters (character set) |                          |
| `[^]`   | Matches any character *not* in the set                     |                          |
| \`      | \`                                                         | Acts like an OR operator |
| `()`    | Groups expressions                                         |                          |
| `{n}`   | Exactly n occurrences                                      |                          |
| `{n,}`  | n or more occurrences                                      |                          |
| `{n,m}` | Between n and m occurrences                                |                          |
| `\`     | Escapes a special character                                |                          |

### How Regular Expressions Work Internally

1. **Compile the pattern**: When you create a RegExp, the engine compiles it into an internal state machine.
2. **Scan the text**: It runs the pattern against the input string, one character at a time.
3. **Match or Fail**: If the pattern matches, it returns the matching portion; otherwise, it fails.

The engine uses backtracking algorithms for complex expressions, which can affect performance in large texts or poorly written patterns.

### Common Flags

Flags modify the behavior of regular expressions:

| Flag | Meaning                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `g`  | Global search (find all matches)                       |
| `i`  | Case-insensitive search                                |
| `m`  | Multi-line mode                                        |
| `s`  | Allows `.` to match newline characters                 |
| `u`  | Treat pattern as a sequence of Unicode code points     |
| `y`  | "Sticky" search: match starting exactly at `lastIndex` |

Example:

```javascript
const regex = /hello/gi; // global and case-insensitive
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Email Validation (Social Media / Sign-up Forms)

When users sign up for a service, you must ensure they input a valid email address:

```javascript
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
const email = "user@example.com";
console.log(emailRegex.test(email)); // true
```

* `^` and `$` ensure the pattern matches the whole string.
* `[^\s@]+` ensures at least one character that's not whitespace or `@`.
* `\.` matches the literal dot.

---

### 2. Search and Replace in a Document Editor (E-commerce Backend CMS)

Imagine you need to replace all the product code references:

```javascript
const text = "Product codes: ABC123, XYZ789.";
const updated = text.replace(/\b[A-Z]{3}\d{3}\b/g, "REPLACED");
console.log(updated); // "Product codes: REPLACED, REPLACED."
```

* `\b` denotes word boundaries.
* `[A-Z]{3}` matches three uppercase letters.
* `\d{3}` matches three digits.

---

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic Matching

```javascript
const regex = /cat/;
const str = "The cat sat on the mat.";
console.log(regex.test(str)); // true
```

### Example 2: Global and Case-Insensitive Search

```javascript
const regex = /dog/gi;
const str = "Dog dog DOG";
console.log(str.match(regex)); // ['Dog', 'dog', 'DOG']
```

### Example 3: Extracting Numbers

```javascript
const regex = /\d+/g;
const str = "Order 123, Item 456, Price 789.";
const numbers = str.match(regex);
console.log(numbers); // ['123', '456', '789']
```

### Example 4: Escaping Special Characters

To match special characters like `.`:

```javascript
const regex = /\./g;
const str = "www.example.com";
console.log(str.match(regex)); // ['.', '.']
```

## Best Practices

* **Keep patterns readable**: Use comments and break complex regex into parts.
* **Use escape sequences properly**: Always escape special characters when you mean them literally.
* **Test your regex**: Tools like [regex101](https://regex101.com/) can help.
* **Avoid catastrophic backtracking**: Poorly designed regex can cause performance issues on large inputs.
* **Use non-capturing groups** (`(?:...)`) when you don’t need the group to capture.

---

## Common Pitfalls

* Forgetting to escape special characters like `.` or `*`.
* Overusing greedy quantifiers (`.*`) without considering lazy versions (`.*?`).
* Not anchoring your regex when needed (`^` and `$`).
* Misunderstanding character classes (`[]`) versus groups (`()`).

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Regular Expressions** help match, search, and replace text patterns efficiently.
* Use `/pattern/flags` or `new RegExp('pattern', 'flags')` to create them.
* Master basic symbols: `^`, `$`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `[]`, `()`, `|`, and `{}`.
* Combine with flags `g`, `i`, `m` to control search behavior.
* Always test complex patterns and optimize for performance.

## Advanced Insights

* **Lookahead and Lookbehind**: Advanced regex features allow checking what comes after/before a match without including it.

  Example of **positive lookahead**:

  ```javascript
  const regex = /\d+(?= dollars)/;
  console.log("100 dollars".match(regex)); // ['100']
  ```

* **Named Capturing Groups** (ES2018+):

  ```javascript
  const regex = /(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/;
  const result = regex.exec("2025-06-02");
  console.log(result.groups); // { year: '2025', month: '06', day: '02' }
  ```
