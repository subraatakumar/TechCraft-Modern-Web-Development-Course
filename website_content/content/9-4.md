# Role-Based Authentication in React Native

## Introduction

In today’s app-driven world, **security and access control** are essential. While simple authentication (verifying that a user is who they say they are) is a must, **authorization** (controlling what resources a user can access) is equally important. One of the most effective ways to handle authorization is through **Role-Based Authentication** (also called Role-Based Access Control — RBAC).

In this chapter, we'll dive deep into what **Role-Based Authentication** means, why it's critical for scalable apps, and how you can implement it effectively in a **React Native** application.

---

## Explanation

### What Is Role-Based Authentication?

**Role-Based Authentication (RBAC)** is a system where permissions to access certain parts of the application are assigned based on a user's role. Rather than giving permissions to each individual user, we assign permissions to roles, and then users are assigned roles.

* **Authentication** = verifying who you are (e.g., via username and password).
* **Authorization** = verifying what you can access (e.g., Admin can add users; normal User cannot).

For example in out Quick commerce app With RBAC:

* Admins can perform all tasks.
* Managers can perform managerial tasks like listing and delisting of any product. Listing and delisting of any client
* Staff can deliver items to the user.
* Clients can sell items on portal.
* user can purchase, cancel and track items


> **Why is it important?**
>
> * **Scalability:** Easy to manage many users by assigning them roles instead of individual permissions.
> * **Security:** Ensures least-privilege access — users get only what they need.
> * **Maintainability:** As your app grows, adding a new role is easier than assigning permissions individually.

---

### How It Works Internally

1. **Sign-up/Login:**

   * When a user logs in, the backend authenticates the user and sends an **access token** (JWT) containing the user's `role` as part of the payload (or claims).

2. **Token Validation:**

   * When making API requests, the token is attached to the request header.
   * The backend checks the token and verifies the user's role to allow or deny access to specific endpoints.

3. **Role-Based Frontend Logic:**

   * On the frontend (React Native), the app render different screens/components based on the user's role.

---

### Common Terminologies

* **Roles:** Labels like `admin`, `user`, `editor`, etc.
* **Permissions:** Actions users with a certain role are allowed to perform.
* **Access Token:** JWT that contains the role in its payload.
* **Protected Route/Component:** A screen or feature that only certain roles can access.

---

## Code Examples

Let’s build a simplified version of **Role-Based Authentication**.

### 1. **User Signup (Backend API Call)**

Example of creating a user with a role:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://backend.ecom.subraatakumar.com/api/v1/auth/signup' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "username": "newuser",
  "password": "Password@123",
  "role": "user"
}'
```

It returns:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "string",
  "refreshToken": "string"
}
```

The `accessToken` will have the `role` information encoded.

---

### 2. **Setting Up Role-Based Authentication in React Native**

Install necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack jwt-decode
```

### 3. **Decoding the JWT to Extract Role**

```javascript
import jwtDecode from 'jwt-decode';

// Example function to decode token
const getUserRoleFromToken = (token) => {
  try {
    const decoded = jwtDecode(token);
    return decoded.role; // Assuming role is stored as "role"
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to decode token', error);
    return null;
  }
};
```

---

### 4. **Role-Based Navigation**

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import jwtDecode from 'jwt-decode';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

// Screens
import AdminDashboard from './screens/AdminDashboard';
import UserDashboard from './screens/UserDashboard';
import LoginScreen from './screens/LoginScreen';

const AppNavigator = () => {
  const [role, setRole] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchRole = async () => {
      const token = await AsyncStorage.getItem('accessToken');
      if (token) {
        const decoded = jwtDecode(token);
        setRole(decoded.role);
      }
    };

    fetchRole();
  }, []);

  if (!role) {
    return (
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Login" component={LoginScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    );
  }

  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      {role === 'admin' ? (
        <Stack.Screen name="AdminDashboard" component={AdminDashboard} />
      ) : (
        <Stack.Screen name="UserDashboard" component={UserDashboard} />
      )}
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <AppNavigator />
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

---

### 5. **Role-Based Component Access**

You can hide/show components based on the role:

```javascript
const Dashboard = ({ role }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome {role}</Text>
      {role === 'admin' && (
        <Button title="Manage Users" onPress={() => { /* navigate to manage users */ }} />
      )}
      <Button title="View Profile" onPress={() => { /* navigate to profile */ }} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always Validate Role on Backend**

   * Never trust the frontend for authorization. Frontend is only for **UI control**, backend is the **true gatekeeper**.

2. **Store Token Securely**

   * Use libraries like `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
   * For higher security, prefer encrypted storage.

3. **Refresh Tokens**

   * Implement token refreshing for better UX.

4. **Minimal Token Payload**

   * Include only essential information like `id`, `username`, and `role` in the JWT payload.

5. **Role Hierarchies**

   * Some apps need hierarchical roles (e.g., `admin > moderator > user`). Plan accordingly.

---

## Common Pitfalls

* **Not verifying role on backend:** Huge security risk.
* **Hardcoding role checks:** Use enums/constants to avoid typos.
* **Storing sensitive data in JWT:** JWT should not contain passwords or sensitive data.
* **No graceful fallback:** Always handle cases where role is invalid or missing.

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Authentication** checks identity; **Authorization** checks permissions.
* **RBAC** simplifies permission management.
* **JWT** commonly stores user roles.
* Frontend can **show/hide** components based on role.
* Backend must **enforce role-based access** for security.

---

## Advanced Insights

### Role Hierarchies

In complex apps, you might have:

```javascript
const Roles = {
  USER: 'user',
  MODERATOR: 'moderator',
  ADMIN: 'admin'
};

const roleHierarchy = {
  user: 1,
  moderator: 2,
  admin: 3
};

function canAccess(requiredRole, userRole) {
  return roleHierarchy[userRole] >= roleHierarchy[requiredRole];
}
```

### Refresh Token Flow

Implement a refresh mechanism to renew the access token without logging the user out:

```javascript
// Pseudo Code
async function refreshAccessToken() {
  const refreshToken = await AsyncStorage.getItem('refreshToken');
  const response = await api.post('/auth/refresh', { refreshToken });
  if (response.ok) {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('accessToken', response.data.accessToken);
  }
}
```

# Conclusion

Role-Based Authentication is an indispensable tool in the React Native developer's toolkit. Whether you are working on a small app or a large enterprise project, knowing how to implement and manage RBAC ensures you build **secure, scalable, and maintainable** applications.

By properly integrating roles into both the backend and frontend, you can control access efficiently and deliver a smooth user experience without compromising security.

## 🛒 Authentication Flow for E-Commerce App (Concept Explanation for Students)

### 🎯 Goal:

Allow users to:

* View the dashboard (product list)
* Add items to cart or favorites **without login**
* **BUT require login** to proceed to checkout

---

## 👤 User Authentication Logic

### 1. **Public Access (No Login Needed)**

* Everyone can:

  * View products (dashboard)
  * Add items to **favorites**
  * Add items to **cart**

> ✅ This makes browsing and engaging easy for first-time users, increasing user retention.

---

### 2. **Restricted Access (Login Required)**

* **Only logged-in users** can:

  * Proceed to **checkout**
  * Place an order

> 🛑 If a user clicks "Checkout" and **has no valid access token**, they are **redirected to the login screen.**

---

## 🔑 Authentication Mechanism

### Tokens Returned by API:

Upon successful login/signup, the API returns:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "...",
  "refreshToken": "..."
}
```

We'll store the `accessToken` securely (e.g., in `AsyncStorage`) and use it to authorize checkout-related actions.

---

## 🧭 Navigation Flow

### ✅ Normal Navigation:

1. **Dashboard → Add to Cart/Favorites → Checkout**
2. If user is authenticated → Go to Checkout Screen

### 🔁 Redirect if Not Logged In:

1. Dashboard → Add to Cart → Click Checkout
2. App checks for `accessToken`
3. If not found:

   * Redirects to **Login Screen**
   * Login screen has a link: `Don't have an account? Sign up`
   * Signup screen has a link: `Already have an account? Login`
4. After login/signup → Navigate back to Checkout screen

---

## 🧠 Educational Takeaways

### 🔐 Why Allow Public Access but Protect Checkout?

* Improves **User Experience**: No forced sign-up just to explore.
* Encourages **engagement**: Users try features before committing.
* Ensures **security**: Only verified users can place orders.

### ⚙️ Concepts Involved

* **React Navigation**: Redirects and stacks
* **JWT Handling**: Storing & verifying tokens
* **Conditional Navigation**: Based on token presence
* **Persistent Storage**: Using AsyncStorage for token storage

---

## ✅ Summary

| Feature               | Requires Login? |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| View Products         | ❌ No            |
| Add to Favorites/Cart | ❌ No            |
| Proceed to Checkout   | ✅ Yes           |
| Place Order           | ✅ Yes           |

Once a user logs in or signs up, they are automatically redirected to the **Checkout Screen**, resuming the process without friction.
