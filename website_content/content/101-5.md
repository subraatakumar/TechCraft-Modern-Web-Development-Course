# Functions (Declaration, Expression, Arrow Functions) in JavaScript

## Introduction

In JavaScript, **functions** are one of the core building blocks. A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task. Instead of writing the same code over and over, we can wrap it inside a function and call it whenever needed.

Functions are important because:

* They help in breaking a large program into smaller, manageable chunks.
* They promote code reuse.
* They improve readability and maintainability.

In this chapter, we will explore **Function Declarations**, **Function Expressions**, and the modern **Arrow Functions**, each having its own syntax and behavior.

## Explanation

### 1. Function Declaration

A **function declaration** defines a named function using the `function` keyword. This type of function is **hoisted**, meaning it can be invoked even before its definition in the code.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
  // function body
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

* `function` is the keyword.
* `greet` is the function name.
* `name` is the parameter.

**Hoisting Behavior:**

```javascript
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

> Even though we called `add()` before it was defined, it works because function declarations are hoisted to the top.

---

### 2. Function Expression

A **function expression** involves creating a function and assigning it to a variable. Unlike function declarations, function expressions are **not hoisted**.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const functionName = function(parameters) {
  // function body
};
```

**Example:**

```javascript
const multiply = function(a, b) {
  return a * b;
};
```

* The function has no name (anonymous function) and is stored in `multiply`.

**Hoisting Behavior:**

```javascript
console.log(subtract(5, 2)); // ❌ ReferenceError

const subtract = function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
};
```

> In this case, trying to call `subtract` before its definition results in an error.

---

### 3. Arrow Functions

Introduced in **ES6 (2015)**, **arrow functions** provide a more concise syntax. They are especially handy for short, one-liner functions.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const functionName = (parameters) => {
  // function body
};
```

Or even shorter:

```javascript
const square = n => n * n;
```

**Example:**

```javascript
const greet = name => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

**Important Characteristics:**

* **No `this` binding**: Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. They inherit `this` from the parent scope.
* **Cannot be used as constructors**: You cannot use `new` with arrow functions.
* **Shorter syntax**: Ideal for simple, one-line functions.

**Arrow Function vs Regular Function:**

```javascript
function traditional() {
  console.log(this); // Refers to the caller
}

const arrow = () => {
  console.log(this); // Refers to the enclosing lexical context
};
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **E-commerce App: Cart Total Calculation**

In a shopping cart, you need to calculate the total price:

```javascript
const cart = [100, 200, 300];

const total = cart.reduce((sum, price) => sum + price, 0);
console.log(total); // 600
```

Here, the arrow function makes the `reduce` callback concise and readable.

### 2. **Social Media App: Filtering Posts**

Imagine filtering posts based on the number of likes:

```javascript
const posts = [
  { title: "Post 1", likes: 120 },
  { title: "Post 2", likes: 80 },
  { title: "Post 3", likes: 200 },
];

const popularPosts = posts.filter(post => post.likes > 100);
console.log(popularPosts);
```

Arrow functions make array methods like `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` much cleaner.

---

## Code Examples

### 1. Function Declaration Example

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

### 2. Function Expression Example

```javascript
const divide = function(a, b) {
  return a / b;
};

console.log(divide(10, 2)); // 5
```

### 3. Arrow Function Example

```javascript
const power = (base, exponent) => Math.pow(base, exponent);

console.log(power(2, 3)); // 8
```

### 4. Arrow Function with No Parameters

```javascript
const greetWorld = () => "Hello, World!";
console.log(greetWorld()); // "Hello, World!"
```

### 5. Returning Objects with Arrow Functions

If you want to return an object, wrap it in parentheses:

```javascript
const createUser = (name, age) => ({
  name: name,
  age: age
});

console.log(createUser('Alice', 25));
```

## Best Practices

* **Use `const`** for function expressions and arrow functions to prevent reassignment.
* **Use descriptive names** for functions to improve code readability.
* **Choose the right function type**:

  * Use **declaration** when hoisting is beneficial.
  * Use **expression** or **arrow function** for callbacks or when you don’t need hoisting.
* **Prefer arrow functions** for small, simple functions and callbacks.
* **Avoid arrow functions** when you need a proper `this` binding, e.g., methods in classes or objects.

---

## Common Mistakes

* Forgetting that arrow functions don’t have their own `this`.
* Misunderstanding hoisting behavior between declaration and expression.
* Trying to use arrow functions as constructors (`new` keyword), which leads to errors.
* Returning objects without parentheses in arrow functions:

  ```javascript
  // Wrong
  const getUser = () => { name: "John" }; // undefined

  // Correct
  const getUser = () => ({ name: "John" });
  ```

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Function Declaration** is hoisted and can be called before its definition.
* **Function Expression** is not hoisted; it’s created at runtime.
* **Arrow Function** provides a shorter syntax and inherits `this` from the parent scope.
* Arrow functions are ideal for callbacks and simple functions but avoid them where a `this` context is needed.
* Always use parentheses when returning an object from an arrow function.

## Advanced Insights (Optional)

### Arrow Functions and `arguments` Object

Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object. If you need to access the arguments passed to a function, use traditional functions.

```javascript
function traditionalFunction() {
  console.log(arguments); // works
}

const arrowFunction = () => {
  console.log(arguments); // ReferenceError
};
```

### Named Function Expressions

You can name a function inside a function expression for better stack traces:

```javascript
const factorial = function fact(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * fact(n - 1);
};

console.log(factorial(5)); // 120
```
