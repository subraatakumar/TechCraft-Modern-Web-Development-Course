# Debouncing and Throttling in JavaScript

## Introduction

In web development, especially when dealing with user interactions, we often encounter performance issues caused by functions firing too frequently — think typing in a search box, resizing a window, or scrolling.

**Debouncing** and **Throttling** are two techniques used to control how often a function gets executed over time. They ensure better performance and improved user experience by limiting the number of times a function runs.

Understanding and using these techniques properly can help avoid performance bottlenecks and make your applications more efficient.

## Explanation

### What is Debouncing?

**Debouncing** is a technique that ensures a function is only executed **after** a specified period of inactivity.

* Imagine a user typing into a search box.
* If we send an API request every time they type a letter, it will flood the server with requests.
* With **debouncing**, the function (like a search API call) will only execute **after** the user has stopped typing for a certain period (say 500ms).

### How Debouncing Works Internally

* When the event fires, a timer is set.
* If the event happens again before the timer ends, the previous timer is canceled and a new timer starts.
* The function only runs if no new events happen during the timer interval.

---

### What is Throttling?

**Throttling** ensures a function is executed **at most once** in a specified time interval, no matter how many times the event is triggered.

* Imagine a window `resize` event.
* If the user resizes rapidly, we might want to limit how often we update the layout.
* With **throttling**, the function will be called **once every X milliseconds** during the continuous stream of events.

### How Throttling Works Internally

* When the event fires, it checks if enough time has passed since the last function call.
* If enough time has passed, it executes the function.
* Otherwise, it ignores the event.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Search Box Suggestions (Debouncing)**

When the user types in a search bar, you don't want to send an API request for every keystroke. Instead, wait until they've stopped typing for 300ms.

### 2. **Scroll Position Updates (Throttling)**

When the user scrolls, you might want to show a “back to top” button or lazy-load more content. Throttle the scroll event to once every 200ms to avoid performance issues.

## Code Examples

### Debouncing Example

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer); // Clear the previous timer
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args); // Call func after delay
    }, delay);
  };
}

// Usage:
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search');

searchInput.addEventListener('input', debounce(function (e) {
  console.log('Searching for:', e.target.value);
}, 500));
```

📝 **Explanation:**

* Every time the user types, the timer resets.
* Only when the user stops typing for 500ms, the API call (here, simulated with `console.log`) happens.

### Throttling Example

```javascript
function throttle(func, interval) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= interval) {
      lastCall = now;
      func.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}

// Usage:
const scrollDiv = document.getElementById('scrollable');

scrollDiv.addEventListener('scroll', throttle(function () {
  console.log('Scroll event at:', new Date().toISOString());
}, 300));
```

📝 **Explanation:**

* Even if the scroll event fires many times per second, it will log at most once every 300ms.

## Best Practices

* **Debounce** for operations where the last action matters:

  * Search inputs, text box validations, auto-saving forms.
* **Throttle** for operations where regular updates are needed:

  * Scrolling, window resizing, button spamming prevention.
* Always clear timeouts (in debouncing) to avoid memory leaks.
* Prefer using a utility library like **Lodash** for complex needs: `_.debounce()` and `_.throttle()` are production-tested.
* Be careful not to over-throttle critical UI updates — it may cause the app to feel unresponsive.

---

## Common Mistakes

* **Confusing Debounce and Throttle**: They solve different problems; debounce waits for inactivity, throttle limits the rate.
* **Memory Leaks**: Forgetting to clear timers when a component unmounts (especially in React).
* **Incorrect Timer Reset**: In throttle, resetting the timer too early can cause extra function calls.

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Debounce** delays execution until after a period of inactivity.
* **Throttle** limits execution to once every specified interval.
* Use **debounce** for search bars, validations, auto-save.
* Use **throttle** for scroll, resize, drag, continuous actions.
* Avoid re-inventing the wheel for complex cases — use libraries like Lodash.

## Advanced Insights

### Debounce with Immediate Option

Sometimes, you might want the function to fire immediately on the first event and debounce only subsequent ones:

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait, immediate) {
  let timeout;
  return function (...args) {
    const callNow = immediate && !timeout;
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      timeout = null;
      if (!immediate) func.apply(this, args);
    }, wait);
    if (callNow) func.apply(this, args);
  };
}

// Usage:
const saveButton = document.getElementById('save');

saveButton.addEventListener('click', debounce(function () {
  console.log('Saved at:', new Date().toISOString());
}, 1000, true)); // Fires immediately, then blocks for 1s
```

### Throttle with Trailing Execution

Advanced throttling can ensure a trailing call at the end of rapid events:

```javascript
function throttleWithTrailing(func, limit) {
  let lastFunc;
  let lastRan;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!lastRan) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      lastRan = Date.now();
    } else {
      clearTimeout(lastFunc);
      lastFunc = setTimeout(() => {
        if ((Date.now() - lastRan) >= limit) {
          func.apply(this, args);
          lastRan = Date.now();
        }
      }, limit - (Date.now() - lastRan));
    }
  };
}
```

This ensures the function runs at least once at the start and once after the events stop.
