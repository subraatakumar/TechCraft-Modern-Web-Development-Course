# 🧠 Understanding the `useContext` Hook in React

## 🎯 Introduction (Beginner-Friendly)

State management is a big part of building modern React apps. Sometimes, passing props through multiple nested components becomes messy and hard to maintain. This is where **React Context** and the `useContext` hook shine.

Instead of "prop drilling," you can create a shared state (or data) and let any component access it—no matter how deeply it's nested.

## 🔧 What is `useContext`?

`useContext` is a React Hook that lets you tap into the values provided by a **Context** object. It replaces the older class-based method of using `MyContext.Consumer`.

### 📘 Syntax:

```js
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

## 🏗️ Setting up a Context (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Create a Context**

```js
import { createContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext();
```

### 2. **Provide a Value**

Wrap your app (or part of it) with a `Provider`:

```js
<ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
  <App />
</ThemeContext.Provider>
```

### 3. **Consume with `useContext`**

```js
import { useContext } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <Text>The theme is {theme}</Text>;
};
```

## 🧑‍💻 Real-world Use Cases

### 1. 🔐 **Authentication State**

Store the logged-in user and share it globally:

```js
const AuthContext = createContext();

export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
```

Usage:

```js
const { user, logout } = useAuth();
```

### 2. 🎨 **Theme Switching (Light/Dark Mode)**

Toggle between themes and apply it app-wide without prop-drilling.

### 3. 📦 **Cart in E-commerce**

Use a `CartContext` to manage cart items and make them accessible from any product or checkout component.

## 📊 Levels of Experience

### 🟢 Freshers (0–1 Year)

* Stick to basic context usage (theme, auth).
* Understand the structure: `createContext`, `Provider`, `useContext`.

### 🟡 Junior Devs (1–3 Years)

* Start modularizing contexts: `AuthContext`, `ThemeContext`, `CartContext`.
* Use custom hooks (`useAuth`, `useCart`) for better reuse.

### 🔵 Mid-Senior Devs (3–6 Years)

* Combine `useContext` with `useReducer` for complex logic.
* Introduce lazy context loading or memoization to avoid unnecessary renders.

## 🧠 Bonus: useContext + useReducer

```js
const CounterContext = createContext();

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default: return state;
  }
};

const CounterProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });
  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </CounterContext.Provider>
  );
};

const CounterDisplay = () => {
  const { state, dispatch } = useContext(CounterContext);
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{state.count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                  | Fix                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Using `useContext` outside a Provider    | Wrap your component tree with the correct Provider     |
| Passing large values without memoization | Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders        |
| Mixing concerns in one context           | Split into small, focused contexts (Auth, Theme, etc.) |

## ✅ Summary

| Concept         | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `createContext` | Creates a new context object                      |
| `.Provider`     | Supplies a value to components under its tree     |
| `useContext`    | Reads the context value from the closest Provider |
