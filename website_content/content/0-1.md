### Traditional Web Applications

In traditional web applications, when a user visits a website, the browser sends a request to the server asking for a web page. The server responds by sending back an HTML document that contains the structure and content of the page.

This HTML can either be:

- A **static file**, which means it’s just a regular `.html` file saved on the server.
- Or it can be **generated dynamically**, where the server creates the HTML on-the-fly based on current data or user actions.

For example, if we want to display how many tasks a user has, the server might create an HTML page like this:

```js
const getHomePage = taskCount => `
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Task Tracker</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome to Task Tracker</h1>
      <p>You have ${taskCount} tasks.</p>
      <a href="/tasks">View tasks</a>
    </body>
  </html>
`;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const html = getHomePage(tasks.length);
  res.send(html);
});
```

In this example, `getHomePage` is a function that returns an HTML string. We use **template literals** (the backtick `` ` `` syntax) to embed variables directly inside the HTML. Here, `${taskCount}` is replaced with the actual number of tasks before sending the HTML to the browser.

This kind of setup is quite common in early-stage or simple web applications. All the logic happens on the **server**, and the browser simply shows whatever it receives.

If the data changes, the browser must reload the page by sending a new request to the server. The browser itself doesn’t know how to update things on its own.

### Technology Used

There are many tools for building traditional web servers, including:

- **Java Spring Boot**
- **Python Flask**
- **Ruby on Rails**
- **PHP**

In this example, we are using **Node.js** with the **Express** library, which is a popular combination for creating web servers in JavaScript.

### Summary

- Traditional web apps rely heavily on the server to build and send complete HTML pages.
- The browser just displays what it gets—it doesn't do much thinking.
- Dynamic content (like the number of tasks) is inserted into HTML templates before sending the page.
- Modern applications often move more logic to the browser, but it’s important to understand this traditional model as a foundation.
