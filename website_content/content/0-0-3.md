### 🔍 What Are DevTools?

**DevTools** (Developer Tools) are built-in tools in browsers that help developers inspect, debug, and analyze websites and web apps.

### 🛠️ Steps to Inspect HTTP Requests Using DevTools

#### ✅ Step 1: Open DevTools

- **Shortcut**:  
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + I`  
  - Mac: `Cmd + Option + I`
- Or: Right-click anywhere on the page → Click **Inspect**

#### ✅ Step 2: Go to the **Network** Tab

- This tab lets you monitor all network activity, including HTTP requests.
- If it's blank, reload the page to see new activity.

### 🔄 Example: Reloading the Page

When you refresh the page with the **Network** tab open:

- You'll see a list of resources being requested:  
  HTML, JS, CSS, images, APIs, fonts, etc.

### 🔍 What Can You Inspect in a Request?

Click on any request (usually a row in the list). It opens a panel with detailed info:

#### 📌 Headers Tab
- **General**: URL, request method (`GET`, `POST`), status code (`200 OK`, `404`, etc.)
- **Request Headers**: Sent by browser (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Authorization`)
- **Response Headers**: Sent by server (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Set-Cookie`)

#### 📦 Payload Tab (for `POST`/`PUT` requests)
- Shows the **body** of the request, like form data or JSON.

#### 📄 Response Tab
- Shows the **raw response body**, like HTML or JSON returned by the server.

#### ⏱ Timing Tab
- Breaks down timing for each phase:
  - DNS Lookup
  - Initial Connection
  - SSL Handshake
  - Time to First Byte (TTFB)
  - Content Download

#### 🎥 Preview Tab (for JSON, HTML, Images)
- Friendly preview of the content. For example:
  - JSON → collapsible format
  - Image → rendered preview

### 🔧 Filters & Tools

- Filter requests by type: **XHR**, **JS**, **CSS**, **Doc**, etc.
- Search: Use the search bar to find specific URLs or text.
- Persist Logs: Check "Preserve log" to keep requests even after navigating.
- Disable Cache: Handy for testing fresh requests (when DevTools is open).
