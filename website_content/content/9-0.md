## System Requirements 

Hereâ€™s a simple checklist for the **basic system requirements** to learn **React Native**:

---

### 1. **Operating System**
- **macOS** (Best if you also want to build for iOS)
- **Windows 10/11** (Good for Android apps)
- **Linux** (Ubuntu/Fedora etc. â€” Android only)

---

### 2. **Processor (CPU)**
- **Minimum:** Intel i5 / Apple M1 or better
- **Recommended:** Intel i7 / M2 / Ryzen 5+ (faster build times)

---

### 3. **Memory (RAM)**
- **Minimum:** 8 GB  
- **Recommended:** 16 GB (especially if you plan to run Android/iOS emulators)

---

### 4. **Storage**
- **Minimum:** 20â€“30 GB free  
- (Youâ€™ll install Node.js, Android Studio, Xcode, emulators, project files.)

---

### 5. **Software**
- **Node.js** (for JavaScript runtime)
- **Watchman** (recommended for macOS)
- **Expo CLI** or **React Native CLI** (depending on approach)
- **Android Studio** (for Android emulator)
- **Xcode** (for iOS emulator, **only on macOS**)

---

### 6. **Internet**
- Needed for downloading packages, libraries, and emulators.

---

**Day 1 â€“ Getting Started**

Since today is Day 1, we wonâ€™t jump into installations or heavy setup tasks.  
Instead, I recommend that you first **go through the official React Native documentation** and **complete the installation process according to your system configuration** at your own pace.

**Important Tip:**  
Whenever possible, use a **physical device** instead of an emulator for testing your apps.  
- **Why?**  
  - Emulators can be slow, especially on machines with lower RAM or older processors.  
  - Physical devices give a much smoother and real-world experience. Something may work fine in emulator but real device will create issue. 
  - You can instantly see and feel the performance of your app as users would.

**Our Approach for the First Few Sessions:**  
- For the first **4â€“5 sessions**, weâ€™ll use an **online editor** â€” [snack.expo.dev](https://snack.expo.dev/) â€” so that you can focus purely on writing and understanding React Native code without worrying about local setup issues.
- After that, weâ€™ll **move to local development** using **VS Code**, where youâ€™ll build apps on your system.

**Action Item:**  
Try to complete the installation and make sure React Native runs successfully on your device within these **first 5 sessions**. This will make your transition to local development smooth and easy.

> **Learning starts slow, but success belongs to those who prepare early. Let's build strong foundations together! ðŸš€**

### What is React Native?

**React Native** is an open-source framework developed by **Meta (formerly Facebook)** that allows you to build applications using **JavaScript** (or **TypeScript**) â€” from a **single codebase**.

Originally designed for mobile apps, React Native can now also target **Android**, **iOS**, **Windows**, **macOS**, and even the **Web**.  

However, in **this course**, we will **focus only on Android and iOS app development**, to build strong mobile development skills first.

React Native uses **native components** under the hood, which means the apps you create feel and perform like true native applications â€” not just like mobile websites.

---

### Why Should You Learn React Native?

- **High Demand in the Industry**  
  Companies prefer React Native to build apps faster and at lower costs across multiple platforms.

- **One Codebase, Multiple Platforms**  
  Write once â€” deploy on Android, iOS (and beyond, if you want later).

- **Faster Development and Testing**  
  Thanks to features like **hot reload** and **live reload**, you can instantly see changes in your app.

- **Strong Ecosystem and Community**  
  Thousands of libraries and tools are available, making your development experience smoother.

- **Excellent Career Opportunities**  
  React Native developers are in high demand and often enjoy better freelance, remote, and full-time job opportunities.

- **Proven Technology**  
  Used by apps like Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Discord, and Uber Eats.

- **Foundation for Cross-Platform Skills**  
  Learning React Native also opens doors toward web and desktop app development in the future.

**Let's Start by Building a Simple Counter App**

Before we dive into complex concepts, it's important to understand this principle:  
> **"Whenever a concept feels tough, use a simple program to understand and prove it."**

To follow this approach, weâ€™ll start by creating a **Counter App** â€” a small project that will help you learn the core concepts like **state management**, **button handling**, and **UI updates** without overwhelming you.

This simple app will become a foundation for handling more advanced topics later on.

---

### Components Required for the Counter App in React Native

To build a basic **Counter App** in React Native, we will mainly use:

1. **View**  
   - A container to hold other UI components.
   - Think of it like a `div` in web development.
   
2. **Text**  
   - To display the counter value and other static or dynamic text.
   
3. **Button**  
   - To trigger actions like incrementing or decrementing the counter.

4. *(Optional later)* **TouchableOpacity** or **Pressable**  
   - For more customized buttons if you want a better UI/UX than the basic `Button` component.

---

### What These Components Map To Under the Hood

React Native **bridges** its components into **platform-specific native components**:

| React Native Component | Android Equivalent | iOS Equivalent | Web Equivalent |
|:------------------------|:-------------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| View                    | `android.view.View` | `UIView`        | `<div>`         |
| Text                    | `android.widget.TextView` | `UILabel`   | `<p>` or `<span>` |
| Button                  | `android.widget.Button` | `UIButton`   | `<button>`      |

**In Short:**  
- When you write `<View>` in React Native, it gets converted into a **native View** (Android/iOS) or a **div** (Web) depending on where the app is running.
- **React Native ensures your app uses real native controls** â€” that's why apps feel fast and responsive, not like a slow web view.

---
 
### Hereâ€™s a **simple and clean Counter App** in **React Native** (perfect for beginners):

---

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const CounterApp = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.counterText}>Counter: {count}</Text>
      <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
        <Button title="Increase" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
        <Button title="Decrease" onPress={() => setCount(count - 1)} />
        <Button title="Reset" onPress={() => setCount(0)} />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

export default CounterApp;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f8f8f8',
  },
  counterText: {
    fontSize: 32,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  buttonContainer: {
    width: '60%',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    height: 150,
  },
});
```

---

### What this code does:
- **`useState`** is used to manage the counter value.
- **`Button`** components are used to **Increase**, **Decrease**, and **Reset** the counter.
- **Basic `StyleSheet`** makes it look neat and centered.

---

Of course! Here's a clear and beginner-friendly explanation:

---

### What is the `StyleSheet` API in React Native?

In React Native, **`StyleSheet`** is a way to **create and manage styles** for your components â€” similar to CSS in web development, but slightly different.

You import it like this:

```javascript
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
```

Then you create styles:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});
```

And you apply styles by passing them to the `style` prop of a component:

```javascript
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text>Hello World</Text>
</View>
```

---

### How is `StyleSheet` Different from CSS?

| Topic                | React Native (`StyleSheet`)                  | Web (CSS)                                |
|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Syntax               | JavaScript object (camelCase keys)           | Plain text (kebab-case)                 |
| Units                | No `px`, `em`, `%` â€” numbers are defaulted to "density-independent pixels" | Must specify units like `px`, `em`, etc. |
| Inheritance          | Styles do **not** inherit like in web        | Many styles inherit (e.g., font, color)  |
| Media Queries        | Handled differently, usually through libraries | Native support in CSS |
| Pseudo-classes       | (like `:hover`, `:focus`) not directly supported | Supported in CSS |
| Performance          | `StyleSheet.create()` optimizes styles for better performance | No optimization by default in CSS |

---

### Key Points to Remember:

- In React Native, styles are **JavaScript objects**, not CSS strings.
- Property names use **camelCase** (`backgroundColor`) instead of **kebab-case** (`background-color`).
- No need to specify units like `px` â€” just write numbers.
- Styles don't automatically inherit â€” you must apply them manually.

---
> **Summary:**  
> React Native styles look *similar* to CSS but behave more like tightly controlled, optimized JavaScript objects.

---

### What is `state` in React Native?

In React Native (and React), **`state`** is a special kind of variable that controls how a **component behaves** and **how it appears on the screen**.

State is **dynamic** â€” it **changes over time** based on user actions (like button clicks, typing, etc.).  
When the **state changes**, **React Native automatically re-renders** the component to reflect the new values in the UI.

---

### Why Can't We Use a Normal Variable Instead?

Imagine you try this:

```javascript
let counter = 0;

const increase = () => {
  counter++;
  console.log(counter);
};
```

Yes, `counter` will increase, but **the UI will NOT update automatically**.

In React Native:
- Normal variables **do not trigger re-rendering** of the screen.
- React Native **won't know** something has changed.
- Your app will feel **broken** or **stuck** because users won't see the updated value.

---

### Example to Prove This

**Using a normal variable (WRONG way):**

```javascript
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

let counter = 0;

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Counter: {counter}</Text> {/* Will not update */}
      <Button title="Increase" onPress={() => counter++} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
ðŸ‘‰ Here, when you press the button, the `counter` value increases **internally**, but **the screen won't update** because React Native is not aware of the change.

---

### Using `state` (CORRECT way):

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Counter: {counter}</Text> {/* Will update automatically */}
      <Button title="Increase" onPress={() => setCounter(counter + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
âœ… Here, when you press the button:
- `setCounter` updates the **state**.
- React Native **knows** something changed.
- React **re-renders** the component.
- The new counter value **appears instantly** on the screen!

---

### A Simple Analogy:
> Think of `state` like a **special signal system** between your data and your screen.  
> If you change the signal (state), React Native **wakes up** and **refreshes** the UI automatically.  
>  
> But if you change a normal variable, React Native **doesnâ€™t notice** â€” so the UI stays stuck.

---

### Key Points About State:
- **State is dynamic** â€” it lets your app respond to user actions.
- **State changes cause re-rendering** â€” keeping the UI in sync with the data.
- **State is isolated per component** â€” each component manages its own private state.

---

## Here's a step-by-step way to **demonstrate** how **state is isolated per component** using the counter example:

---

### Updated Counter App with Separate Components

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

// Counter component
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View style={styles.counterContainer}>
      <Text style={styles.counterText}>Counter: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increase" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

// Parent App component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.heading}>Multiple Counters</Text>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    paddingTop: 50,
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5',
  },
  heading: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  counterContainer: {
    marginVertical: 10,
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  counterText: {
    fontSize: 28,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
});
```

---

### What this shows:
- We have **one `App` component** (the main parent).
- Inside it, we have **three `Counter` components**.
- **Each `Counter` has its own separate state (`count`)**.
- **Increasing one counter** doesnâ€™t affect the others â€” because **each component manages its own private state** using its own `useState()` hook.

âœ… **Proof:**  
- Press "Increase" on the first counter âž” only that counterâ€™s number increases.  
- The second and third counters stay the same!

---

### Quick Real-World Analogy
> Think of each Counter component as a **separate stopwatch**.  
> Even though all stopwatches look similar, they all **track their own time independently**.  
> Similarly, each component **tracks its own state independently**.
