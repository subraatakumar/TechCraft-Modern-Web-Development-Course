# React Native Introduction Session

**Unlock Your True Potential with React Native**

This course is thoughtfully designed for **beginners** and **mid-level engineers** who are ready to level up their careers.  
If you are new to React Native and fully commit to the learning journey — practicing consistently and applying the concepts — you can confidently aim for a salary package between **3 to 7 LPA**, based on your dedication and skill mastery.

> **Remember:** Success depends on your effort.  
> Follow the course sincerely, and doors of opportunity will open. Without real effort, frustration can happen — but if you stay committed, growth will surely follow.

If you already have **2+ years of experience** and feel underpaid (earning below **7 LPA**), this course can empower you to break through and target the **7 to 10 LPA** range — by sharpening your skills to meet industry expectations.

Throughout the course, we'll focus on **building real-world, production-grade applications** — preparing you not just to clear interviews, but to thrive in your job and build a lasting career.

> **This is not just a course. It's a stepping stone toward your next big opportunity.**


## System Requirements 

Here’s a simple checklist for the **basic system requirements** to learn **React Native**:

---

### 1. **Operating System**
- **macOS** (Best if you also want to build for iOS)
- **Windows 10/11** (Good for Android apps)
- **Linux** (Ubuntu/Fedora etc. — Android only)

---

### 2. **Processor (CPU)**
- **Minimum:** Intel i5 / Apple M1 or better
- **Recommended:** Intel i7 / M2 / Ryzen 5+ (faster build times)

---

### 3. **Memory (RAM)**
- **Minimum:** 8 GB  
- **Recommended:** 16 GB (especially if you plan to run Android/iOS emulators)

---

### 4. **Storage**
- **Minimum:** 20–30 GB free  
- (You’ll install Node.js, Android Studio, Xcode, emulators, project files.)

---

### 5. **Software**
- **Node.js** (for JavaScript runtime)
- **Watchman** (recommended for macOS)
- **Expo CLI** or **React Native CLI** (depending on approach)
- **Android Studio** (for Android emulator)
- **Xcode** (for iOS emulator, **only on macOS**)

---

### 6. **Internet**
- Needed for downloading packages, libraries, and emulators.

**Day 1 – Getting Started**

Since today is Day 1, we won’t jump into installations or heavy setup tasks.  
Instead, I recommend that you first **go through the official React Native documentation** and **complete the installation process according to your system configuration** at your own pace.

**Important Tip:**  
Whenever possible, use a **physical device** instead of an emulator for testing your apps.  
- **Why?**  
  - Emulators can be slow, especially on machines with lower RAM or older processors.  
  - Physical devices give a much smoother and real-world experience. Something may work fine in emulator but real device will create issue. 
  - You can instantly see and feel the performance of your app as users would.

**Our Approach for the First Few Sessions:**  
- For the first **4–5 sessions**, we’ll use an **online editor** — [snack.expo.dev](https://snack.expo.dev/) — so that you can focus purely on writing and understanding React Native code without worrying about local setup issues.
- After that, we’ll **move to local development** using **VS Code**, where you’ll build apps on your system.

**Action Item:**  
Try to complete the installation and make sure React Native runs successfully on your device within these **first 5 sessions**. This will make your transition to local development smooth and easy.

> **Learning starts slow, but success belongs to those who prepare early. Let's build strong foundations together! 🚀**

### What is React Native?

**React Native** is an open-source framework developed by **Meta (formerly Facebook)** that allows you to build applications using **JavaScript** (or **TypeScript**) — from a **single codebase**.

Originally designed for mobile apps, React Native can now also target **Android**, **iOS**, **Windows**, **macOS**, and even the **Web**.  

However, in **this course**, we will **focus only on Android and iOS app development**, to build strong mobile development skills first.

React Native uses **native components** under the hood, which means the apps you create feel and perform like true native applications — not just like mobile websites.

---

### Why Should You Learn React Native?

- **High Demand in the Industry**  
  Companies prefer React Native to build apps faster and at lower costs across multiple platforms.

- **One Codebase, Multiple Platforms**  
  Write once — deploy on Android, iOS (and beyond, if you want later).

- **Faster Development and Testing**  
  Thanks to features like **hot reload** and **live reload**, you can instantly see changes in your app.

- **Strong Ecosystem and Community**  
  Thousands of libraries and tools are available, making your development experience smoother.

- **Excellent Career Opportunities**  
  React Native developers are in high demand and often enjoy better freelance, remote, and full-time job opportunities.

- **Proven Technology**  
  Used by apps like Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Discord, and Uber Eats.

- **Foundation for Cross-Platform Skills**  
  Learning React Native also opens doors toward web and desktop app development in the future.

**Let's Start by Building a Simple Counter App**

Before we dive into complex concepts, it's important to understand this principle:  
> **"Whenever a concept feels tough, use a simple program to understand and prove it."**

To follow this approach, we’ll start by creating a **Counter App** — a small project that will help you learn the core concepts like **state management**, **button handling**, and **UI updates** without overwhelming you.

This simple app will become a foundation for handling more advanced topics later on.

---

### Components Required for the Counter App in React Native

To build a basic **Counter App** in React Native, we will mainly use:

1. **View**  
   - A container to hold other UI components.
   - Think of it like a `div` in web development.
   
2. **Text**  
   - To display the counter value and other static or dynamic text.
   
3. **Button**  
   - To trigger actions like incrementing or decrementing the counter.

4. *(Optional later)* **TouchableOpacity** or **Pressable**  
   - For more customized buttons if you want a better UI/UX than the basic `Button` component.

---

### What These Components Map To Under the Hood

React Native **bridges** its components into **platform-specific native components**:

| React Native Component | Android Equivalent | iOS Equivalent | Web Equivalent |
|:------------------------|:-------------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| View                    | `android.view.View` | `UIView`        | `<div>`         |
| Text                    | `android.widget.TextView` | `UILabel`   | `<p>` or `<span>` |
| Button                  | `android.widget.Button` | `UIButton`   | `<button>`      |

**In Short:**  
- When you write `<View>` in React Native, it gets converted into a **native View** (Android/iOS) or a **div** (Web) depending on where the app is running.
- **React Native ensures your app uses real native controls** — that's why apps feel fast and responsive, not like a slow web view.
