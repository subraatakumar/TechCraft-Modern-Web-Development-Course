This course is thoughtfully designed for **beginners** and **mid-level engineers** who are ready to level up their careers.  
If you are new to React Native and fully commit to the learning journey — practicing consistently and applying the concepts — you can confidently aim for a salary package between **3 to 7 LPA**, based on your dedication and skill mastery.

> **Remember:** Success depends on your effort.  
> Follow the course sincerely, and doors of opportunity will open. Without real effort, frustration can happen — but if you stay committed, growth will surely follow.
