# LocalStorage and SessionStorage in JavaScript

## Introduction

When building web applications, we often need to save data on the user's browser. This might be to remember preferences, keep a user logged in, or save items in a shopping cart.

Two powerful tools provided by the browser for this purpose are **LocalStorage** and **SessionStorage**. Together, they form part of the **Web Storage API** and allow developers to store key-value pairs locally within the user's browser without affecting server-side storage or requiring a database.

But what's the difference between them? How do they work? And when should you use one over the other? Let's dive deep and explore.

## Explanation

### What is Web Storage?

Web Storage provides a simple API for storing data as key-value pairs on the client side. It has two main types:

1. **LocalStorage**:

   * Data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
   * Think of it as long-term storage.

2. **SessionStorage**:

   * Data is only available for the duration of the page session (i.e., until the browser or tab is closed).
   * Think of it as temporary storage for that session only.

### How It Works Internally

* **Storage Location**:

  * Data is stored in the browser's memory or disk under the domain name.
* **Security**:

  * Data is **origin-specific** — only scripts from the same domain can access the stored data.
* **Size Limitations**:

  * Typically around **5MB per domain** (but can vary by browser).
* **Storage Type**:

  * Stored as **strings**. If you need to store objects, you have to serialize them (e.g., using `JSON.stringify`).
* **Persistence**:

  * LocalStorage stays until explicitly deleted.
  * SessionStorage is deleted when the tab or window is closed.

## Syntax and Usage

Both LocalStorage and SessionStorage have similar methods:

| Method                | Description          |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `setItem(key, value)` | Save data            |
| `getItem(key)`        | Retrieve data        |
| `removeItem(key)`     | Delete specific data |
| `clear()`             | Clear all data       |

### Example — LocalStorage

```javascript
// Save data
localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');

// Retrieve data
const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
console.log(username); // Output: JohnDoe

// Remove data
localStorage.removeItem('username');

// Clear all data
localStorage.clear();
```

### Example — SessionStorage

```javascript
// Save data
sessionStorage.setItem('sessionUser', 'JaneDoe');

// Retrieve data
const sessionUser = sessionStorage.getItem('sessionUser');
console.log(sessionUser); // Output: JaneDoe

// Remove data
sessionStorage.removeItem('sessionUser');

// Clear all data
sessionStorage.clear();
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **E-commerce Cart (LocalStorage)**

Imagine you're building a shopping cart feature. You want the cart to persist even if the user closes the browser and comes back later.

```javascript
let cart = [{ id: 1, name: 'Laptop', quantity: 1 }];

// Save to LocalStorage
localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart));

// Retrieve and parse
let savedCart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cart'));
console.log(savedCart); 
```

### 2. **Login Session (SessionStorage)**

For sensitive data like authentication tokens for a single session:

```javascript
// Save session token
sessionStorage.setItem('authToken', 'abc123xyz');

// Use it for API calls
const token = sessionStorage.getItem('authToken');
fetch('/user-data', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

When the user closes the browser, the session ends, and the token is automatically removed.

## Best Practices

* **Use JSON for complex data**:

  * Always serialize objects using `JSON.stringify()` when saving.
  * Always parse with `JSON.parse()` when retrieving.

```javascript
// Saving an object
const user = { id: 1, name: 'Alice' };
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));

// Retrieving an object
const userData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
```

* **Don’t store sensitive data**:

  * Never store passwords, credit card information, or sensitive tokens without proper security — data in LocalStorage and SessionStorage is accessible via JavaScript and can be compromised.

* **Be aware of size limits**:

  * If you need to store large amounts of data, consider using IndexedDB instead.

* **Graceful fallbacks**:

  * Always check if `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` is available in the browser:

```javascript
if (typeof(Storage) !== 'undefined') {
  // Storage is available
} else {
  console.log('Web Storage not supported!');
}
```

* **Handle QuotaExceededError**:

  * If storage is full, browsers will throw an error; be ready to catch and handle it.

---

## Common Mistakes

* **Forgetting JSON.stringify/parse**:

  * Directly storing objects will not work as expected — they are saved as `[object Object]`.

* **Not handling session expiration**:

  * If you expect data to persist but use `sessionStorage`, users will lose data after closing the tab.

* **Assuming data security**:

  * LocalStorage is **not secure** — don't assume that data saved there is safe from prying eyes.

---

## Key Takeaways

* **LocalStorage** is best for data that needs to persist across sessions.
* **SessionStorage** is best for data that should disappear after a session ends.
* Data is stored as **key-value pairs**, with **values as strings**.
* Always use `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` for objects.
* Never store sensitive information in LocalStorage or SessionStorage.
* Both are **synchronous** — large reads/writes can block the main thread.
* Check for browser support before using Web Storage.

## Advanced Insights

### Storage Events

Browsers emit a **storage event** when a storage area (localStorage or sessionStorage) changes in another tab:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('storage', function(event) {
  console.log('Key changed:', event.key);
  console.log('New value:', event.newValue);
});
```

Useful for synchronizing data across multiple tabs/windows.

### Expiry Mechanisms

Unlike cookies, neither LocalStorage nor SessionStorage has an expiration mechanism. If you want expiry, you have to manually implement it:

```javascript
const saveWithExpiry = (key, value, ttl) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const item = {
    value: value,
    expiry: now.getTime() + ttl,
  };
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(item));
};

const getWithExpiry = (key) => {
  const itemStr = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (!itemStr) return null;

  const item = JSON.parse(itemStr);
  const now = new Date();

  if (now.getTime() > item.expiry) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
    return null;
  }
  return item.value;
};

// Save with expiry of 1 minute
saveWithExpiry('data', 'Hello World!', 60000);

// Retrieve data
console.log(getWithExpiry('data'));
```
