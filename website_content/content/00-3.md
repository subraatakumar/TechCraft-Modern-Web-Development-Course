## 🧰 2. Building a Strong Portfolio

A degree might get your foot in the door — but your **portfolio** gets you hired.

Here’s how to build a standout one:

### 📁 What to include in your portfolio:

- ✅ 3–5 projects that **solve real-world problems**  
- ✅ Clear GitHub repositories with clean code and README files  
- ✅ Live demos using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku  
- ✅ Use technologies that are **in demand** (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)  
- ✅ Document your **thought process** — not just the code  

### 💡 Project Ideas:

- A weather app using APIs  
- A personal finance tracker  
- A task management web app  
- A clone of popular apps (Instagram clone, YouTube searcher)  
- A machine learning model that predicts housing prices

### 🔍 Pro Tip:
Even small projects matter — it’s about **how well** you build, test, and explain them.

And don’t forget to **write about your projects** — blogs or LinkedIn posts help showcase your learning journey.
