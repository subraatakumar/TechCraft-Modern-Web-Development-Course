# Strict Mode (`'use strict'`)

## Introduction

JavaScript is a very flexible language — sometimes too flexible! In its early days, JavaScript allowed developers to write code with little restriction, often leading to bugs that were difficult to debug. To address this, **Strict Mode** was introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5).

Strict Mode is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript. It deliberately makes certain errors throw exceptions that would otherwise be ignored, helping developers write cleaner, more secure, and bug-free code.

**Why is it important?**

* It catches common coding mistakes.
* It makes your code more secure.
* It prepares your code for future versions of JavaScript.
* It helps avoid problematic features like global variable leakage.

---

## Explanation

Strict Mode changes the normal behavior of JavaScript in a few important ways:

1. **Eliminates some silent errors** by changing them to throw errors.
2. **Fixes mistakes** that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations.
3. **Prohibits some syntax** likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.

### How it works internally

When JavaScript code is in strict mode:

* It parses the code differently.
* It enforces stricter parsing and error handling at runtime.
* It disables certain dangerous or deprecated features like:

  * Implicit global variables.
  * Assignments to non-writable properties.
  * Using `with` statements.

This helps both developers and JavaScript engines to create more predictable and optimized code.

---

## Syntax

Strict Mode can be enabled by placing the following directive at the top of a script or function:

```javascript
'use strict';
```

* **Whole Script**: Place it at the top of a JS file.
* **Specific Function**: Place it at the top inside a function body.

### Example: Whole script strict mode

```javascript
'use strict';
x = 5; // ❌ ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

### Example: Function level strict mode

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  'use strict';
  y = 10; // ❌ ReferenceError: y is not defined
}
```

> **Note**: `"use strict"` must be the first statement in the script or function to take effect.

---

## Common Mistakes and Pitfalls

* Forgetting to put `'use strict';` at the very beginning — any code before it will disable strict mode.
* Applying `'use strict';` inside a block `{}` — it won't work; strict mode applies to entire functions or scripts only.
* Older browsers (pre-IE10) do not fully support strict mode — but this is rarely a concern today.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Preventing Global Variable Leaks**

In large applications (like e-commerce sites), accidentally creating global variables can cause bugs that are hard to trace.

```javascript
// Without strict mode
function addToCart() {
  cartCount = 10; // Creates a global variable if 'var', 'let', or 'const' is not used
}

// With strict mode
'use strict';
function addToCart() {
  cartCount = 10; // ❌ ReferenceError: cartCount is not defined
}
```

Strict Mode forces you to explicitly declare variables, making code safer.

---

### 2. **Secure Financial Calculations**

In banking systems, accidental assignments to non-writable properties can compromise data.

```javascript
'use strict';

const account = {};
Object.defineProperty(account, 'balance', {
  value: 1000,
  writable: false
});

account.balance = 2000; // ❌ TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'balance'
```

Without strict mode, this assignment would silently fail; with strict mode, it throws an error, preventing unnoticed bugs.

---

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Assignment to Undeclared Variables

```javascript
'use strict';

function calculateTotal(price) {
  total = price + 100; // ❌ ReferenceError
}

calculateTotal(500);
```

Without strict mode, `total` becomes a global variable, polluting the global namespace.

---

### Example 2: Duplicate Parameter Names

```javascript
'use strict';

function sum(a, a) { // ❌ SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context
  return a + a;
}
```

Strict mode disallows duplicate parameter names, preventing confusing bugs.

---

### Example 3: Using `with` Statement

```javascript
'use strict';

var obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
with (obj) { // ❌ SyntaxError: Strict mode code may not include a with statement
  console.log(a);
}
```

`with` makes scope resolution confusing and unpredictable, hence disallowed in strict mode.

---

## Best Practices

* Always use `'use strict';` in new JavaScript code.
* Place it at the very top of your script or function.
* Use tools like linters (`eslint`) that warn if you're missing strict mode.
* Avoid using strict mode inside blocks `{}` — use it inside functions or the whole script.
* If using ES6 modules (`import`/`export`), **strict mode is enabled by default** — no need to specify it manually.

---

## Key Takeaways

* `'use strict';` enables a restricted variant of JavaScript.
* Catches silent errors and makes debugging easier.
* Must be the first statement in a script or function.
* Helps write cleaner, safer, and more future-proof code.
* ES6 modules are automatically in strict mode.

---

## Advanced Insights

* **Strict mode is scoped**: You can apply it to specific functions rather than the whole script, which is useful in legacy codebases where you can't switch the entire codebase to strict mode at once.

* **In Classes and Modules**: If you are using modern JavaScript syntax like classes or modules, strict mode is **implicitly enabled**, so you don't need to write `'use strict';`.

```javascript
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

Here, strict mode is automatically applied.

✨ **Quick Example Recap:**

```javascript
'use strict';

// Good practice: Always declare variables
let count = 0;

// Mistake: Assignment to undeclared variable
value = 10; // ❌ ReferenceError

// Good: No duplicate parameter names
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```
