# Scope (Global, Function, Block) in JavaScript

## Introduction

When we write JavaScript code, we often use variables to store and manipulate data. However, not all variables are available everywhere in the code — their *visibility* depends on something called **scope**.

**Scope** defines where a variable or function is accessible within your code. It helps organize and protect variables by limiting where they can be used, avoiding naming conflicts and accidental changes.

Understanding scope is critical for:

* Writing error-free code.
* Avoiding variable clashes in large projects.
* Managing memory efficiently.
* Controlling access to data.

In JavaScript, there are mainly **three types of scopes**:

1. **Global Scope**
2. **Function Scope**
3. **Block Scope**

Let’s dive deeper!

## Explanation

### 1. Global Scope

**Global scope** means a variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.

* Variables declared **outside** any function or block belong to the global scope.
* In browsers, global variables become properties of the `window` object.

```javascript
var globalVar = "I'm global!";

function showGlobalVar() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible here
}

showGlobalVar();
console.log(globalVar); // Also accessible here
```

> **Note**: Global variables can easily collide with other scripts. Overusing them is a bad practice.

---

### 2. Function Scope

**Function scope** means a variable is accessible *only within the function* where it's declared.

* Variables declared with `var` inside a function are **local** to that function.
* They cannot be accessed outside the function.

```javascript
function greet() {
  var message = "Hello, World!";
  console.log(message); // Works fine
}

greet();
console.log(message); // ❌ Error: message is not defined
```

**How it works internally**:

* When a function is invoked, a **new execution context** is created.
* This context has its own *variable environment* where the function’s variables are stored.

---

### 3. Block Scope

**Block scope** refers to variables that are only accessible within a specific block `{}`.

* `let` and `const` (introduced in ES6) have block scope.
* `var` does NOT have block scope (it’s function-scoped).

```javascript
{
  let blockVar = "Inside block";
  const anotherBlockVar = "Still inside block";
  console.log(blockVar); // Works
}

console.log(blockVar); // ❌ Error: blockVar is not defined
```

> **Block** refers to `{}` used in loops, conditionals, etc.

```javascript
if (true) {
  let temp = "Scoped to if block";
}
console.log(temp); // ❌ Error: temp is not defined
```

**Important Note**:

* `var` is hoisted to the function/global scope.
* `let` and `const` are hoisted too but remain in a *"temporal dead zone"* until they are defined.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. E-commerce Shopping Cart

In an online shopping cart:

* You might keep the **cart items** in a variable.
* The cart items should only be accessible within the shopping cart module to prevent accidental changes.

```javascript
function ShoppingCart() {
  let items = []; // Function-scoped

  function addItem(item) {
    items.push(item);
  }

  function getItems() {
    return items;
  }

  return { addItem, getItems };
}

const cart = ShoppingCart();
cart.addItem('Laptop');
console.log(cart.getItems()); // ['Laptop']
```

> `items` is safely tucked away inside `ShoppingCart()` and can't be accessed directly from outside.

### 2. User Authentication in Social Media App

When authenticating a user:

* Tokens (like `authToken`) should be scoped properly.
* They should not leak into the global scope for security reasons.

```javascript
function authenticateUser() {
  const authToken = "secret_token"; // Function-scoped
  console.log("User authenticated!");
}

authenticateUser();
console.log(authToken); // ❌ Error: authToken is not defined
```

---

## Code Examples

### Global, Function, and Block Scopes Together

```javascript
var globalVar = "Global";

function exampleFunction() {
  var functionVar = "Function";

  if (true) {
    let blockVar = "Block";
    console.log(globalVar);   // Global
    console.log(functionVar); // Function
    console.log(blockVar);    // Block
  }

  console.log(globalVar);   // Global
  console.log(functionVar); // Function
  // console.log(blockVar); // ❌ Error
}

exampleFunction();
```

### Common Mistake with `var`

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); 
}
// Output: 3 3 3 (Not 0 1 2)

for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 1000); 
}
// Output: 0 1 2 (Correct!)
```

Why? Because `var` is function-scoped — the same `i` is shared across all loop iterations. `let` creates a new binding for each iteration.

## Best Practices

* **Minimize Global Variables**: Use modules or closures to keep variables scoped properly.
* **Use `let` and `const` instead of `var`**: They provide block scoping and reduce bugs.
* **Initialize Variables Close to Usage**: Improves readability and scope management.
* **Be Mindful of Hoisting**: Understand that `var` hoists differently from `let` and `const`.
* **Avoid Polluting the Global Scope**: Wrap your code inside IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) or modules.

```javascript
(function() {
  // All variables here are not global
})();
```

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Global Scope**: Variables available everywhere. Declared outside functions/blocks.
* **Function Scope**: Variables declared inside a function. Invisible outside.
* **Block Scope**: Variables (`let`, `const`) limited to `{}` blocks.
* **Prefer `let`/`const` over `var`**: To leverage block scope and avoid hoisting pitfalls.
* **Avoid Global Pollution**: Reduces risks of naming conflicts and hard-to-find bugs.

## Advanced Insights

### Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

* Variables declared with `let` and `const` exist in a "dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered.
* Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
{
  console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError
  let a = 10;
}
```

### Lexical Scope

JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, meaning the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code, not how or when it’s called.

```javascript
function outer() {
  let outerVar = "I'm outside!";

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // inner() can access outerVar
  }

  return inner;
}

const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc(); // I'm outside!
```
