🎯 **How Does a Computer Understand Code?**

Imagine you're a chef following a recipe — but it's written in French, and you only understand English. You need a translator, right?

That’s exactly how computers work.

We write code in **high-level languages** like **Python, JavaScript, Java, or C++** — clean and readable for humans.
But computers? They only understand **machine code** — a language of 0s and 1s.

🛠️ So what acts as the translator?

* A **compiler**, like in **C++**, translates the entire code into machine language *before* execution.
* An **interpreter**, like in **Python**, reads it *line by line* as it runs.
* **Java** does both — it compiles to bytecode, then the **JVM** runs it.
* And **JavaScript**? It’s interpreted by your browser’s engine — like **Chrome’s V8** — turning your code into fast, executable instructions on the fly.

So remember — your code speaks to you.
But the computer? It listens to the translator.
