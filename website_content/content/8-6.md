# useMemo Hook in React

## Introduction

When building React applications, performance optimization becomes crucial, especially as your app grows in size and complexity.

Imagine a situation where your app re-renders too often or unnecessarily recalculates expensive operations even when not needed. This is where **`useMemo`** comes to the rescue.

**`useMemo`** is a React Hook that helps you **optimize performance** by **memoizing** the result of expensive calculations — caching the output and recalculating it **only when necessary**.

In simple terms:

> **`useMemo`** remembers the **computed result** of a function, and **recomputes** it **only when its dependencies change**.

---

## Explanation

### What is `useMemo`?

`useMemo` is a hook provided by React to **memorize** the output of a function **between renders** unless its **dependencies** change.

Syntax:

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

* The first argument is a **function** whose result you want to memoize.
* The second argument is a **dependency array** (`[a, b]`).
* React **only re-computes** the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed.

### Why is `useMemo` Important?

Without `useMemo`, in every render, your component would **recalculate** the result of expensive operations, even if the inputs haven’t changed — wasting CPU cycles and slowing down your app.

With `useMemo`, React can **skip recalculations** and **reuse the cached result** — boosting **rendering performance** and **improving efficiency**.

---

### How `useMemo` Works Internally

Think of `useMemo` like this:

* On initial render:

  * It calls the function, stores the result, and keeps track of the dependencies.
* On subsequent renders:

  * If **dependencies are the same**, React **returns the cached result**.
  * If **dependencies have changed**, React calls the function again and stores the new result.

It uses **referential equality** (`===`) to compare dependency values.

⚠️ **Important:**

* `useMemo` is **not a general caching mechanism** — it's scoped to the **component** and **the render cycle**.
* It **only** improves **CPU performance**, not network or memory usage.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. E-commerce Product Filtering

In an e-commerce app, filtering a large list of products can be an expensive operation. You can use `useMemo` to cache the filtered products list until the filters change.

```javascript
const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {
  return products.filter(product => product.category === selectedCategory);
}, [products, selectedCategory]);
```

Here, the filtering operation only recalculates when either `products` or `selectedCategory` changes.

### 2. Social Media Feed Sorting

In a social media app, sorting the feed by likes, comments, or date is costly when there are thousands of posts.

```javascript
const sortedPosts = useMemo(() => {
  return [...posts].sort((a, b) => b.likes - a.likes);
}, [posts]);
```

If the `posts` array doesn't change, React uses the previously sorted list.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({ number }) {
  // Expensive computation
  const factorial = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Calculating factorial...');
    let result = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
      result *= i;
    }
    return result;
  }, [number]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Factorial of {number} is {factorial}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(1);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <ExpensiveComponent number={count} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setOtherState(!otherState)}>Toggle</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

👉 Notice: Even when `otherState` changes, `factorial` won't be recalculated because `number` hasn’t changed.

### Example 2: Avoiding Unnecessary Calculations in Lists

```javascript
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

const generateItems = (count) => {
  console.log('Generating items...');
  return Array.from({ length: count }, (_, i) => `Item ${i + 1}`);
};

function ListComponent({ itemCount }) {
  const items = useMemo(() => generateItems(itemCount), [itemCount]);

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(10);

  return (
    <div>
      <ListComponent itemCount={count} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 5)}>Add 5 Items</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

* ✅ **Use `useMemo` for expensive computations** only — unnecessary memoization can actually hurt performance by adding overhead.
* ✅ **Keep dependency arrays accurate** — missing dependencies can cause stale or incorrect data.
* ❌ **Don't overuse** — React's default rendering is highly optimized; unnecessary `useMemo` can complicate code without real benefits.
* ✅ **Prefer readability** — only optimize when you have actual performance issues.

---

## Common Pitfalls

* **Incorrect Dependency Array:** If you forget to list a dependency, you may see outdated or stale results.
* **Over-Memoization:** Applying `useMemo` to cheap calculations leads to extra complexity and sometimes even worse performance.
* **Mistaking `useMemo` for `useCallback`:** `useMemo` memoizes **values**, `useCallback` memoizes **functions**.

---

## Key Takeaways

* `useMemo` **caches the result** of an expensive function and **recalculates only when dependencies change**.
* It improves performance by **avoiding unnecessary recalculations** during re-renders.
* **Syntax**:

  ```javascript
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
  ```
* Best for **heavy calculations** like filtering, sorting, or complex computations.
* **Use it wisely** — premature optimization can make code harder to understand and maintain.

---

## Advanced Insights (Optional)

* **Nested Dependencies:** If your computation depends on an object or array, ensure you are careful about how these dependencies are updated — consider memoizing the object itself or using `useCallback` where applicable.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** `useMemo` works the same way in SSR, but be cautious that memoized data is component-instance-specific.
* **Large-Scale Applications:** In apps with large state trees, memoizing derived state using `useMemo` can avoid passing down freshly calculated props unnecessarily.
