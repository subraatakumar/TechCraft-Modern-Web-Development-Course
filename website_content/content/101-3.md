# Conditionals (if, else, switch) in JavaScript

## Introduction

Imagine you're ordering coffee at a café. You might say:

* "If they have cappuccino, I'll take one."
* "Otherwise, I'll have a latte."
* "If neither is available, just give me tea."

This is **conditional thinking** — making decisions based on different situations.

In programming, **conditionals** allow computers to make similar decisions. They let us execute different code based on whether certain conditions are true or false. **Conditionals** are fundamental because most real-world applications depend on dynamic behaviors — decisions based on user input, system status, or external data.

In JavaScript, the primary tools for making decisions are:

* `if`, `else if`, `else`
* `switch`

These control structures make programs flexible and dynamic, letting them respond intelligently instead of behaving the same way every time.

## Explanation

### How Conditionals Work

Conditionals evaluate **expressions** that return a **Boolean value** (`true` or `false`). Based on the result:

* If `true`, a block of code is executed.
* If `false`, the block is skipped, and the program may move on to an `else` block or another condition.

---

### `if` Statement

The simplest form:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

* **`condition`** must be an expression that returns `true` or `false`.
* Curly braces `{}` group multiple statements.

Example:

```javascript
let isLoggedIn = true;

if (isLoggedIn) {
  console.log("Welcome back!");
}
```

---

### `if...else` Statement

What if the condition is false? We can add `else`:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // run if condition is true
} else {
  // run if condition is false
}
```

Example:

```javascript
let isRaining = false;

if (isRaining) {
  console.log("Take an umbrella.");
} else {
  console.log("No need for an umbrella.");
}
```

---

### `else if` Ladder

Sometimes you have multiple conditions:

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // run if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // run if condition2 is true
} else {
  // run if none of the above are true
}
```

Example:

```javascript
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: C");
}
```

---

### `switch` Statement

When you have multiple conditions based on a single value, `switch` is clearer:

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code block
    break;
  case value2:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
```

* `expression` is evaluated once.
* The value is compared with `case` labels using **strict comparison (`===`)**.
* `break` prevents "fall-through" — without it, execution continues to the next case.

Example:

```javascript
let day = 3;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Another day");
}
```

---

### How It Works Internally (Simplified)

* **`if` statements** evaluate conditions top-down until a true one is found.
* **`switch`** creates a jump table — optimized lookup based on value matching.
* JavaScript converts non-Boolean conditions to Boolean using coercion (`truthy`/`falsy` values).

Example:

```javascript
if ("hello") {
  console.log("This runs because non-empty strings are truthy.");
}
```

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **E-commerce: Shopping Cart Checkout**

```javascript
let cartItems = 0;

if (cartItems === 0) {
  console.log("Your cart is empty.");
} else {
  console.log("Proceed to checkout.");
}
```

* Checks if the user can proceed based on cart contents.

### 2. **Social Media: Post Visibility**

```javascript
let privacySetting = "friends";

switch (privacySetting) {
  case "public":
    console.log("Post visible to everyone.");
    break;
  case "friends":
    console.log("Post visible to friends only.");
    break;
  case "private":
    console.log("Post visible only to you.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown privacy setting.");
}
```

* Manages who can see a post based on user's settings.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Simple `if...else`

```javascript
let temperature = 30;

if (temperature > 25) {
  console.log("It's hot outside.");
} else {
  console.log("It's nice outside.");
}
```

### Example 2: Grading System with `else if`

```javascript
let marks = 75;

if (marks >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (marks >= 60) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: D");
}
```

### Example 3: Menu Selection using `switch`

```javascript
let choice = "coffee";

switch (choice) {
  case "tea":
    console.log("You selected tea.");
    break;
  case "coffee":
    console.log("You selected coffee.");
    break;
  case "juice":
    console.log("You selected juice.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid choice.");
}
```

## Best Practices

* Always use curly braces `{}` even for single-line blocks to improve readability:

  ```javascript
  if (isReady) {
    start();
  }
  ```

* Avoid deeply nested `if...else` — refactor with early returns or `switch`.

* Be cautious of **type coercion** — use strict equality (`===`), not loose (`==`).

* Use `default` in `switch` for unhandled cases.

* Remember to add `break` statements in `switch` to prevent fall-through.

* When dealing with many conditions based on a single variable, prefer `switch` over `else if` for clarity.

---

## Common Mistakes

* **Forgetting `break`** in `switch` leads to unexpected fall-through.

* **Using assignment `=` instead of comparison `==` or `===`** in conditions:

  ```javascript
  if (x = 5) { // WRONG! Assignment instead of comparison
  }
  ```

* **Overcomplicating logic** with too many nested `if` statements — keep it clean and readable.

* **Misunderstanding truthy/falsy values**:

  ```javascript
  if (0) {
    console.log("This won't run because 0 is falsy.");
  }
  ```

---

## Key Takeaways

* Conditionals control the flow of programs based on dynamic decisions.
* `if...else` handles binary and multi-way branching.
* `switch` is better for multiple distinct values of a single variable.
* Always use `{}` braces, `===` strict equality, and `break` in `switch`.
* Watch out for truthy/falsy quirks and accidental assignments.

## Advanced Insights

### Short-circuiting with Logical Operators

Sometimes you can avoid `if` altogether:

```javascript
let user = isLoggedIn && "Welcome back!";
console.log(user); // "Welcome back!" if isLoggedIn is true
```

### Ternary Operator `? :`

For short `if...else` expressions:

```javascript
let age = 20;
let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(canVote); // "Yes"
```

But don't overuse it — complex ternaries reduce readability.
