# Objects and Object Methods in JavaScript

## Introduction

Imagine trying to organize all the details about a car — its brand, model, color, and how it can start or stop. Managing all of that with separate variables would be chaotic! Instead, we bundle related information and behavior together using **objects**.

In JavaScript, **objects** are collections of related data and functionality. They allow us to group multiple values (properties) and actions (methods) into a single unit, making our code cleaner, more manageable, and closer to how we think about real-world entities.

Understanding objects and their methods is crucial because they are at the heart of JavaScript programming — from simple web apps to complex server-side code.

## Explanation

### What is an Object?

An object in JavaScript is a standalone entity, with **properties** (data) and **methods** (functions acting on the data). Think of it as a collection of key-value pairs:

```javascript
const car = {
  brand: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  start: function() {
    console.log("Car started");
  }
};
```

* **Properties**: `brand`, `model`
* **Methods**: `start()`

### How Objects Work Internally

Internally, JavaScript objects are implemented as hash tables — collections of key-value pairs where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type.

When you access a property:

```javascript
car.brand
```

JavaScript looks up the key `"brand"` in the object’s internal table and retrieves the corresponding value.

JavaScript also supports prototype-based inheritance, meaning objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.

### Syntax: Creating and Using Objects

**1. Object Literal**

The most common and easiest way:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  greet: function() {
    return `Hello, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`;
  }
};
```

**2. Using `new Object()`**

Less common, but still valid:

```javascript
const person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
```

**3. Using a Constructor Function**

For creating multiple similar objects:

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.greet = function() {
    return `Hello, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`;
  };
}

const john = new Person("John", "Doe");
```

**4. Using Classes (ES6 Syntax)**

A modern approach:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  greet() {
    return `Hello, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`;
  }
}

const john = new Person("John", "Doe");
```

### Common Object Methods

JavaScript provides several built-in methods to work with objects:

* `Object.keys(obj)`: Returns an array of property names.
* `Object.values(obj)`: Returns an array of property values.
* `Object.entries(obj)`: Returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs.
* `Object.assign(target, source)`: Copies properties from source to target.
* `Object.freeze(obj)`: Makes an object immutable.
* `Object.hasOwnProperty(prop)`: Checks if an object has a property.

Example:

```javascript
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
console.log(Object.keys(user)); // ['name', 'age']
console.log(Object.values(user)); // ['Alice', 25]
console.log(Object.entries(user)); // [['name', 'Alice'], ['age', 25]]
```

---

### Common Mistakes

* **Accidentally overwriting properties**:

```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice" };
obj.name = "Bob"; // Overwrites "Alice"
```

* **Forgetting `this` keyword** inside methods:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name); // Always use this.name
  }
};
```

Without `this`, JavaScript will look for a variable `name` in the current scope, which can lead to unexpected `undefined` values.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **E-commerce Product Objects**

Each product can be represented as an object with properties like `name`, `price`, `quantity`, and methods like `applyDiscount()`:

```javascript
const product = {
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 1000,
  applyDiscount: function(discount) {
    this.price -= discount;
  }
};
```

### 2. **Social Media User Profiles**

User data such as name, age, posts, and actions like `addFriend()` or `sendMessage()` can be encapsulated in objects:

```javascript
const user = {
  username: "tech_guru",
  posts: [],
  addPost: function(post) {
    this.posts.push(post);
  }
};
```

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Object with Method

```javascript
const dog = {
  name: "Buddy",
  breed: "Golden Retriever",
  bark: function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says Woof!`);
  }
};

dog.bark(); // Buddy says Woof!
```

### Example 2: Object Methods Using `this`

```javascript
const bankAccount = {
  owner: "John Doe",
  balance: 1000,
  deposit: function(amount) {
    this.balance += amount;
    console.log(`Deposited ${amount}. New balance is ${this.balance}`);
  },
  withdraw: function(amount) {
    if (amount > this.balance) {
      console.log("Insufficient funds");
    } else {
      this.balance -= amount;
      console.log(`Withdrew ${amount}. New balance is ${this.balance}`);
    }
  }
};

bankAccount.deposit(500); // Deposited 500. New balance is 1500
bankAccount.withdraw(2000); // Insufficient funds
```

## Best Practices

* **Use meaningful property names** — Make the object self-explanatory.
* **Use `this` carefully** — Especially inside object methods.
* **Avoid large, deeply nested objects** — Break them into smaller objects where possible.
* **Freeze objects if they shouldn’t change** — Use `Object.freeze()`.
* **Use classes or factory functions** — For creating multiple similar objects.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Objects group data (properties) and functions (methods) into a single entity.
* Properties hold values, methods define behavior.
* Objects can be created using literals, constructors, or classes.
* Built-in methods like `Object.keys()` and `Object.values()` help manipulate objects.
* Always use `this` to refer to the current object inside methods.
* Objects form the foundation for JSON, APIs, and real-world app models.

## Advanced Insights

### Prototypes and Inheritance

All JavaScript objects have a hidden property `[[Prototype]]` linking to another object. This is how JavaScript supports **prototypal inheritance** — allowing one object to inherit properties and methods from another.

```javascript
const animal = {
  eats: true
};

const rabbit = Object.create(animal);
rabbit.hops = true;

console.log(rabbit.eats); // true (inherited)
console.log(rabbit.hops); // true (own property)
```

This inheritance pattern is fundamental in building efficient, reusable code structures in JavaScript.
