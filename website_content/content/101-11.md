# Event Handling (Bubbling, Delegation)

## Introduction

In modern web development, **interacting with users** is a key part of building dynamic websites and applications. Whether it's clicking a button, submitting a form, or hovering over an element — all these are **events**. **Event handling** is the mechanism that allows developers to respond to these user actions.

But as applications grow complex with hundreds or thousands of elements, **efficient event handling** becomes important. That's where concepts like **event bubbling** and **event delegation** come into play.

Understanding how events flow through the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manage them efficiently can drastically improve the performance and maintainability of your web applications.

## Explanation

### What is an Event?

An **event** is an action or occurrence recognized by the browser, such as clicks, form submissions, keypresses, and mouse movements.

**Event handling** involves:

* Detecting when an event occurs.
* Responding appropriately to that event.

We use methods like `addEventListener()` to attach event handlers to elements.

---

### Event Bubbling

**Event bubbling** is the process where an event starts from the **target element** and **bubbles up** through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy.

For example:

* If you click a `<button>` inside a `<div>`, the click event first triggers on the `<button>`, then moves up to the `<div>`, and further up to `<body>`, `<html>`, and finally `document`.

**Visual Representation:**

```
<button> inside <div> inside <body>
Click → button → div → body → html → document
```

**Why is it called bubbling?**
Because the event "bubbles" up from the deepest element towards the root.

**Key Point:**
In JavaScript, by default, events bubble unless explicitly handled otherwise.

---

### Event Delegation

**Event delegation** is a pattern based on event bubbling where you:

* Attach a **single event listener** to a **common ancestor** (like a parent `<ul>`).
* Use that single listener to manage events on all of its child elements.

Instead of adding an event listener to each `<li>` item, you add one to the `<ul>`, and inside your handler, determine which child element triggered the event.

**Why is it useful?**

* Better **performance**: Fewer listeners in the DOM.
* Handles **dynamic elements**: Works for elements added later.

---

### How It Works Internally

* When you click on an element, the event triggers.
* The browser creates an **event object** and sends it through three phases:

  1. **Capturing Phase** (optional, less used): Event travels from the root down to the target.
  2. **Target Phase**: Event reaches the target element.
  3. **Bubbling Phase**: Event bubbles up from the target to the root.

JavaScript event listeners default to the **bubbling phase**.

You can specify the phase by passing a third parameter to `addEventListener`:

```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', handler, { capture: true });
```

or simply `true` in older code:

```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', handler, true);
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **E-commerce Site - Product List**

Imagine an e-commerce page with 100+ products displayed in a list. Attaching individual `click` listeners to each product is inefficient.

**Solution**: Attach one listener to the parent container (`<ul>`), and handle clicks using event delegation.

### 2. **Social Media Feed**

Social media apps often dynamically load posts as you scroll (infinite scrolling). You can't pre-attach event listeners to posts that don't exist yet.

**Solution**: Use event delegation on the feed container.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Event Bubbling

```javascript
// HTML Structure
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click Me</button>
</div>

// JavaScript
document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  console.log('Child Clicked');
});

document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  console.log('Parent Clicked');
});
```

**Output when button is clicked:**

```
Child Clicked
Parent Clicked
```

The event bubbles up from `child` to `parent`.

---

### Example 2: Event Delegation

```javascript
// HTML Structure
<ul id="productList">
  <li>Product 1</li>
  <li>Product 2</li>
  <li>Product 3</li>
</ul>

// JavaScript
document.getElementById('productList').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log('You clicked on', event.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

**Explanation:**

* One event listener on `#productList`.
* When any `<li>` is clicked, `event.target` identifies the clicked item.

---

## Best Practices

* **Use event delegation** for dynamic content.
* **Stop propagation** when necessary:

  ```javascript
  event.stopPropagation();
  ```
* **Avoid unnecessary listeners** on many child elements.
* **Check `event.target`** carefully to ensure you're handling the correct elements.
* **Use `closest()`** method for better delegation in nested structures:

  ```javascript
  const item = event.target.closest('li');
  ```

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Event Bubbling**: Events move from the target up through its ancestors.
* **Event Delegation**: Handle multiple child elements with one parent event listener.
* **Performance**: Delegation saves memory and improves speed.
* **Dynamic Elements**: Delegation allows handling elements added later.
* **`event.target` vs `event.currentTarget`**:

  * `event.target`: Element that triggered the event.
  * `event.currentTarget`: Element the event listener is attached to.

---

## Advanced Insights

* **Custom Events**: You can create and dispatch your own events using `new CustomEvent()`.
* **Passive Event Listeners**: For better performance (especially scroll events), you can mark listeners as passive:

  ```javascript
  element.addEventListener('scroll', handler, { passive: true });
  ```
* **Capturing Phase**: If you need to catch events on their way *down* the DOM tree, set the `capture` option to `true`.
* **Memory Leaks**: Remove event listeners (`removeEventListener`) if the parent element is being removed to avoid memory leaks.
